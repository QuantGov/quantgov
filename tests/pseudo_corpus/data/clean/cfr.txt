                               EXPLANATION

    The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive 
departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided 
into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal 
regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the 
name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into 
parts covering specific regulatory areas.
    Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year 
and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:

Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1
Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1
Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1
Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1

    The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each 
volume.

LEGAL STATUS

    The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially 
noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie 
evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).

HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS

    The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual 
issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used 
together to determine the latest version of any given rule.
    To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its 
revision date (in this case, April 1, 2016), consult the ``List of CFR 
Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative 
List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of 
the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal 
Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.

EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES

    Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal 
Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source 
citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page 
number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication 
dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be 
exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In 
instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the 
Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In 
those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register 
states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.

OMB CONTROL NUMBERS

    The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires 
Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information 
collection request.

[[Page vi]]

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as 
amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are 
placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting 
requirements.

PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE

    Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of 
the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. 
Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date 
in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected 
(LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections 
Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to 
the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult 
previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 
2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published 
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.

``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY

    The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of 
Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a 
``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used 
editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and 
not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.

INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

    What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was 
established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the 
requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring 
to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be 
valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal 
effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as 
if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). 
This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force 
of law.
    What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the 
Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when 
the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which 
approval is based are:
    (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of 
material published in the Federal Register.
    (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent 
necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative 
process.
    (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for 
publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.
    What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If 
you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as 
an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that 
issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after 
contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please 
notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, 
or call 202-741-6010.

CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES

    A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a 
separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index 
and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities 
and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an 
alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in 
this volume.

[[Page vii]]

    An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within 
that volume.
    The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. 
This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in 
the daily Federal Register.
    A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to 
the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

REPUBLICATION OF MATERIAL

    There are no restrictions on the republication of material appearing 
in the Code of Federal Regulations.

with unless such word, statement, or information also appears on the 
outer container or wrapper of the retail package of the article, or, as 
stated in paragraph (e) of this section, such information is easily 
legible by virtue of the transparency of the outer wrapper or container. 
Where a consumer commodity is marketed in a multiunit retail package 
bearing the mandatory label information as required by this part and the 
unit containers are not intended to be sold separately, the net weight 
placement requirement of Sec.  101.105(f) applicable to such unit

from required label statements.

    Section 403(e) of the act (in this part 1, the term act means the

regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages 
from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section

exemptions from the required declaration of ingredients where such 
declaration is impracticable, or results in deception or unfair 
competition. Section 502(b) of the act provides for the establishment by 
regulation of reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages 
from the required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 
602(b) of the act provides for the establishment by regulation of 
reasonable variations and exemptions for small packages from the 
required declaration of net quantity of contents. Section 5(b) of the 
Fair Packaging and Labeling Act provides for the establishment by 
regulation of exemptions from certain required declarations of net 
quantity of contents, identity of commodity, identity and location of 
manufacturer, packer, or distributor, and from declaration of net 
quantity of servings represented, based on a finding that full 
compliance with such required declarations is impracticable or not 
necessary for the adequate protection of consumers, and a further 
finding that the nature, form, or quantity of the packaged consumer 
commodity or other good and sufficient reasons

[[Page 11]]

justify such exemptions. The Commissioner, on his own initiative or on 
petition of an interested person, may propose a variation or exemption 
based upon any of the foregoing statutory provisions, including proposed 
findings if section 5(b) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act applies, 
pursuant to parts 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of this chapter.



Sec.  1.24  Exemptions from required label statements.

    The following exemptions are granted from label statements required 
by this part:
    (a) Foods. (1) While held for sale, a food shall be exempt from the 
required declaration of net quantity of contents specified in this part 
if said food is received in bulk containers at a retail establishment 
and is accurately weighed, measured, or counted either within the view 
of the purchaser or in compliance with the purchaser's order.
    (2) Random food packages, as defined in Sec.  101.105(j) of this 
chapter, bearing labels declaring net weight, price per pound or per 
specified number of pounds, and total price shall be exempt from the 
type size, dual declaration, and placement requirements of Sec.  101.105 
of this chapter if the accurate statement of net weight is presented 
conspicuously on the principal display panel of the package. In the case 
of food packed in random packages at one place for subsequent shipment 
and sale at another, the price sections of the label may be left blank 
provided they are filled in by the seller prior to retail sale. This 
exemption shall also apply to uniform weight packages of cheese and 
cheese products labeled in the same manner and by the same type of 
equipment as random food packages exempted by this paragraph (a)(2) 
except that the labels shall bear a declaration of price per pound and 
not price per specified number of pounds.
    (3) Individual serving-size packages of foods containing less than 
\1/2\ ounce or less than \1/2\ fluid ounce for use in restaurants, 
institutions, and passenger carriers, and not intended for sale at 
retail, shall be exempt from the required declaration of net quantity of 
contents specified in this part.
    (4) Individually wrapped pieces of penny candy and other 
confectionery of less than one-half ounce net weight per individual 
piece shall be exempt from the labeling requirements of this part when 
the container in which such confectionery is shipped is in conformance 
with the labeling requirements of this part. Similarly, when such 
confectionery items are sold in bags or boxes, such items shall be 
exempt from the labeling requirements of this part, including the 
required declaration of net quantity of contents specified in this part 
when the declaration on the bag or box meets the requirements of this 
part.
    (5)(i) Soft drinks packaged in bottles shall be exempt from the 
placement requirements for the statement of identity prescribed by Sec.  
101.3 (a) and (d) of this chapter if such statement appears 
conspicuously on the bottle closure. When such soft drinks are marketed 
in a multiunit retail package, the multiunit retail package shall be 
exempt from the statement of identity declaration requirements 
prescribed by Sec.  101.3 of this chapter if the statement of identity 
on the unit container is not obscured by the multiunit retail package.
    (ii) A multiunit retail package for soft drinks shall be exempt from 
the declaration regarding name and place of business required by Sec.  
101.5 of this chapter if the package does not obscure the declaration on 
unit containers or if it bears a statement that the declaration can be 
found on the unit containers and the declaration on the unit containers 
complies with Sec.  101.5 of this chapter. The declaration required by 
Sec.  101.5 of this chapter may appear on the top or side of the closure 
of bottled soft drinks if the statement is conspicuous and easily 
legible.
    (iii) Soft drinks packaged in bottles which display other required 
label information only on the closure shall be exempt from the placement 
requirements for the declaration of contents prescribed by Sec.  
101.105(f) of this chapter if the required content declaration is blown, 
formed, or molded into the surface of the bottle in close proximity to 
the closure.
    (iv) Where a trademark on a soft drink package also serves as, or 
is, a statement of identity, the use of such

[[Page 12]]

trademark on the package in lines not parallel to the base on which the 
package rests shall be exempted from the requirement of Sec.  101.3(d) 
of this chapter that the statement be in lines parallel to the base so 
long as there is also at least one statement of identity in lines 
generally parallel to the base.
    (v) A multiunit retail package for soft drinks in cans shall be 
exempt from the declaration regarding name and place of business 
required by Sec.  101.5 of this chapter if the package does not obscure 
the declaration on unit containers or if it bears a statement that the 
declaration can be found on the unit containers and the declaration on 
the unit containers complies with Sec.  101.5 of this chapter. The 
declaration required by Sec.  101.5 of this chapter may appear on the 
top of soft drinks in cans if the statement is conspicuous and easily

Sec.  1.83  Definitions.

    For the purposes of regulations prescribed under section 801(a), 
(b), and (c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
    (a) The term owner or consignee means the person who has the rights 
of a consignee under the provisions of sections 483, 484, and 485 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1483, 1484, 1485).
    (b) The term district director means the director of the district of 
the Food and Drug Administration having jurisdiction over the port of 
entry through which an article is imported or offered for import, or 
such officer of the district as he may designate to act in his behalf in 
administering and enforcing the provisions of section 801 (a), (b), and 
(c).



Sec.  1.90  Notice of sampling.

    When a sample of an article offered for import has been requested by 
the district director, the collector of customs having jurisdiction over 
the article shall give to the owner or consignee prompt notice of 
delivery of, or intention to deliver, such sample. Upon receipt of the 
notice, the owner or consignee shall hold such article and not 
distribute it until further notice from the district director or the 
collector of customs of the results of examination of the sample.



Sec.  1.91  Payment for samples.

    The Food and Drug Administration will pay for all import samples 
which are found to be in compliance with the requirements of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Billing for reimbursement should be made 
by the owner or consignee to the Food and Drug Administration district 
headquarters in whose territory the shipment was offered for import. 
Payment for samples will not be made if the article is found to be in 
violation of the act, even though subsequently brought into compliance 
under the terms of an authorization to bring the article into compliance 
or rendered not a food, drug, device, or cosmetic as set forth in Sec.  
1.95.



Sec.  1.94  Hearing on refusal of admission or destruction.

    (a) If it appears that the article may be subject to refusal of 
admission, or that the article is a drug that may be subject to 
destruction under section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, the district director shall give the owner or consignee a written 
notice to that effect, stating the reasons therefor. The notice shall 
specify a place and a period of time during which the owner or consignee 
shall have an opportunity to introduce testimony. Upon timely request 
giving reasonable grounds therefor, such time and place may be changed. 
Such testimony shall be confined to matters relevant to the 
admissibility or destruction of the article, and may be introduced 
orally or in writing.
    (b) If such owner or consignee submits or indicates his or her 
intention to submit an application for authorization to relabel or 
perform other action to bring the article into compliance with the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or to render it other than a food, 
drug, device, or cosmetic, such testimony shall include evidence in 
support of such application. If such application is not submitted at or 
prior to the hearing on refusal of admission, the district director 
shall specify a time limit, reasonable in the light of

[[Page 16]]

the circumstances, for filing such application.
    (c) If the article is a drug that may be subject to destruction 
under section 801(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the 
district director may give the owner or consignee a single written 
notice that provides the notice on refusal of admission and the notice 
on destruction of an article described in paragraph (a) of this section. 
The district director may also combine the hearing on refusal of 
admission with the hearing on destruction of the article described in 
paragraph (a) of this section into a single proceeding.

or cosmetic.
    (b) Specify the time and place where such operations will be carried 
out and the approximate time for their completion.



Sec.  1.96  Granting of authorization to relabel and recondition.

    (a) When authorization contemplated by Sec.  1.95 is granted, the 
district director shall notify the applicant in writing, specifying:
    (1) The procedure to be followed;
    (2) The disposition of the rejected articles or portions thereof;
    (3) That the operations are to be carried out under the supervision 
of an officer of the Food and Drug Administration or the U.S. Customs 
Service, as the case may be;
    (4) A time limit, reasonable in the light of the circumstances, for 
completion of the operations; and
    (5) Such other conditions as are necessary to maintain adequate 
supervision and control over the article.
    (b) Upon receipt of a written request for extension of time to 
complete such operations, containing reasonable grounds therefor, the 
district director may grant such additional time as he deems necessary.
    (c) An authorization may be amended upon a showing of reasonable 
grounds therefor and the filing of an amended application for 
authorization with the district director.
    (d) If ownership of an article covered by an authorization changes 
before the operations specified in the authorization have been 
completed, the original owner will be held responsible, unless the new 
owner has executed a bond and obtained a new authorization. Any 
authorization granted under this section shall supersede and nullify any 
previously granted authorization with respect to the article.

[42 FR 15553, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 54 FR 9033, Mar. 3, 1989]



Sec.  1.97  Bonds.

executed by the owner or consignee on the appropriate form of a customs 
single-entry or term bond, containing a condition for the redelivery of 
the merchandise or any part thereof upon demand of the collector of 
customs and containing a provision for the performance of conditions as 
may legally be imposed for the relabeling or other action necessary to 
bring the article into compliance with the act or rendering it other 
than a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, in such manner as is prescribed 
for such bond in the customs regulations in force on the date of request 
for authorization. The bond shall be filed with the collector of 
customs.
    (b) The collector of customs may cancel the liability for liquidated 
damages incurred under the above-mentioned provisions of such a bond, if 
he receives an application for relief therefrom, upon the payment of a 
lesser amount or upon such other terms and conditions as shall be deemed 
appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances, but the 
collector shall not act under this regulation in any case unless the 
district director is in full agreement with the action.

with an import of food, drugs, devices, or cosmetics which fails to

Subparts F-G [Reserved]



                Subpart H_Registration of Food Facilities

    Source: 68 FR 58960, Oct. 10, 2003, unless otherwise noted.

                           General Provisions



Sec.  1.225  Who must register under this subpart?

    (a) You must register your facility under this subpart if you are 
the owner, operator, or agent in charge of either a domestic or foreign 
facility, as defined in this subpart, and your facility is engaged in 
the manufacturing/processing, packing, or holding of food for 
consumption in the United States, unless your facility qualifies for one 
of the exemptions in Sec.  1.226.
    (b) If you are an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a domestic 
facility, you must register your facility whether or not the food from 
the facility enters interstate commerce.
    (c) If you are the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a 
facility, you may authorize an individual to register your facility on 
your behalf.



Sec.  1.226  Who does not have to register under this subpart?

    This subpart does not apply to the following facilities:
    (a) A foreign facility, if food from such facility undergoes further 
manufacturing/processing (including packaging) by another facility 
outside the United States. A facility is not exempt under this provision 
if the further manufacturing/processing (including packaging) conducted 
by the subsequent facility consists of adding labeling or any similar 
activity of a de minimis nature;
    (b) Farms;
    (c) Retail food establishments;
    (d) Restaurants;

[[Page 20]]

    (e) Nonprofit food establishments in which food is prepared for, or 
served directly to, the consumer;
    (f) Fishing vessels, including those that not only harvest and 
transport fish but also engage in practices such as heading, 
eviscerating, or freezing intended solely to prepare fish for holding on 
board a harvest vessel. However, those fishing vessels otherwise engaged 
in processing fish are subject to this subpart. For the purposes of this 
section, ``processing'' means handling, storing, preparing, shucking, 
changing into different market forms, manufacturing, preserving, 
packing, labeling, dockside unloading, holding, or heading, 
eviscerating, or freezing other than solely to prepare fish for holding 
on board a harvest vessel;
    (g) Facilities that are regulated exclusively, throughout the entire 
facility, by the U.S. Department of Agriculture under the Federal Meat 
Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Poultry Products Inspection 
Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), or the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 
U.S.C. 1031 et seq.);



Sec.  1.227  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act apply to such terms when used in this subpart. In 
addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
    Calendar day means every day shown on the calendar.
    Facility means any establishment, structure, or structures under one 
ownership at one general physical location, or, in the case of a mobile 
facility, traveling to multiple locations, that manufactures/processes, 
packs, or holds food for consumption in the United States. Transport 
vehicles are not facilities if they hold food only in the usual course 
of business as carriers. A facility may consist of one or more 
contiguous structures, and a single building may house more than one 
distinct facility if the facilities are under separate ownership. The 
private residence of an individual is not a facility. Nonbottled water 
drinking water collection and distribution establishments and their 
structures are not facilities.
    (1) Domestic facility means any facility located in any State or 
Territory of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds 
food for consumption in the United States.
    (2) Foreign facility means a facility other than a domestic facility 
that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for consumption in the 
United States.
    Farm means:
    (1) Primary production farm. A primary production farm is an 
operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily 
contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the 
harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any 
combination of these activities. The term ``farm'' includes operations 
that, in addition to these activities:
    (i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
    (ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food 
used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm 
under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph 
(1)(iii)(B)(1) of this definition; and
    (iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
    (A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or 
another farm under the same management; or
    (B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on 
that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
    (1) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a 
distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce 
raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without 
additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional 
manufacturing/processing is slicing);
    (2) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural 
commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and 
packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without 
additional manufacturing/processing; and
    (3) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these 
activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an 
example of

[[Page 21]]

additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
    (2) Secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm is an 
operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to 
harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw 
agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) 
that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural 
commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities 
farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary 
activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those 
additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described 
in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
    Food has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act:
    (1) Except for purposes of this subpart, it does not include:
    (i) Food contact substances as defined in section 409(h)(6) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; or
    (ii) Pesticides as defined in 7 U.S.C. 136(u).
    (2) Examples of food include: Fruits, vegetables, fish, dairy 
products, eggs, raw agricultural commodities for use as food or as 
components of food, animal feed (including pet food), food and feed 
ingredients, food and feed additives, dietary supplements and dietary 
ingredients, infant formula, beverages (including alcoholic beverages 
and bottled water), live food animals, bakery goods, snack foods, candy, 
and canned foods.
    Harvesting applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means 
activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of 
removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or 
raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to 
activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed 
foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without 
additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not 
include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a 
processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise 
separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from 
the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural 
commodity (e.g., foliage, husks, roots or stems). Examples of harvesting 
also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, hulling, 
shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and washing 
raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
    Holding means storage of food and also includes activities performed 
incidental to storage of a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe 
or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during 
storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the 
drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/
dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed 
as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as 
blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down 
pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 
201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities 
could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain 
elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
    Manufacturing/processing means making food from one or more 
ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or 
manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of 
manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, 
canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw 
agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/
dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, 
extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, 
irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified 
atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to 
manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and

[[Page 22]]

farm mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include 
activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
    Mixed-type facility means an establishment that engages in both 
activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the 
establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a 
``farm mixed-type facility,'' which is an establishment that is a farm, 
but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require 
the establishment to be registered.
    Nonprofit food establishment means a charitable entity that prepares 
or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or 
meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The 
term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food 
delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the 
establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
    Packaging (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container 
that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
    Packing means placing food into a container other than packaging the 
food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to 
packing or re-packing a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe or 
effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, 
grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-
packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in 
section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    Restaurant means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to 
consumers for immediate consumption. ``Restaurant'' does not include 
facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central 
kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve 
food directly to consumers.
    (1) Entities in which food is provided to humans, such as 
cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food 
stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital 
kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens are restaurants; 
and
    (2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food 
is provided to animals are restaurants.
    Retail food establishment means an establishment that sells food 
products directly to consumers as its primary function. A retail food 
establishment may manufacture/process, pack, or hold food if the 
establishment's primary function is to sell from that establishment 
food, including food that it manufactures/processes, packs, or holds, 
directly to consumers. A retail food establishment's primary function is 
to sell food directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales 
of food products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value 
of sales of food products to all other buyers. The term ``consumers'' 
does not include businesses. A ``retail food establishment'' includes 
grocery stores, convenience stores, and vending machine locations.
    Trade name means the name or names under which the facility conducts 
business, or additional names by which the facility is known. A trade 
name is associated with a facility, and a brand name is associated with 
a product.
    U.S. agent means a person (as defined in section 201(e) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act residing or maintaining a place of 
business in the United States whom a foreign facility designates as its 
agent for purposes of this subpart. A U.S. agent cannot be in the form 
of a mailbox, answering machine or service, or other place where an 
individual acting as the foreign facility's agent is not physically 
present.
    (1) The U.S. agent acts as a communications link between the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA) and the foreign facility for both 
emergency and routine communications. The U.S. agent will be the person 
FDA contacts when an emergency occurs, unless the registration specifies 
under Sec.  1.233(e) another emergency contact.

[[Page 23]]

    (2) FDA will treat representations by the U.S. agent as those of the 
foreign facility, and will consider information or documents provided to 
the U.S. agent the equivalent of providing the information or documents 
to the foreign facility.
    (3) Having a single U.S. agent for the purposes of this subpart does 
not preclude facilities from having multiple agents (such as foreign 
suppliers) for other business purposes. A firm's commercial business in 
the United States need not be conducted through the U.S. agent 
designated for purposes of this subpart.
    You or registrant means the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a 
facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for 
consumption in the United States.

mail address;
    (e) For a foreign facility, an emergency contact name, title, phone 
number and e-mail address. FDA will consider the facility's U.S. agent 
the facility's emergency contact unless the facility chooses to 
designate another person to serve as an emergency contact under this 
section;
    (f) For a foreign facility, title, fax number, and e-mail address of 
the U.S. agent;
    (g) Type of activity conducted at the facility (e.g., manufacturing/
processing or holding);
    (h) Food categories not identified in Sec.  170.3 of this chapter,

    In addition to the requirements of this subpart, you must comply 
with the registration regulations found in part 108 of this chapter, 
related to emergency permit control, and any other Federal, State, or 
local registration requirements that apply to your facility.



Sec.  1.241  What are the consequences of failing to register, update,
or cancel your registration?

    (a) Section 301 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
prohibits the doing of certain acts or causing such acts to be done. 
Under section 302 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the 
United States can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin a 
person who commits a prohibited act. Under section 303 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the United States can bring a criminal 
action in Federal court to prosecute a person who is responsible for the 
commission of a prohibited act. Under section 306 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA can seek debarment of any person who has 
been convicted of a felony relating to importation of food into the 
United States. Failure of an owner, operator, or agent in charge of a 
domestic or foreign facility to register its facility, to update 
required elements of its facility's registration, or to cancel its 
registration in accordance with the requirements of this subpart is a 
prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act.
    (b) FDA will cancel a registration if the agency independently 
verifies that the facility is no longer in business or has changed 
owners, and the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the facility 
fails to cancel the registration, or if FDA determines that the 
registration is for a facility that does not exist. If FDA cancels a 
facility's registration, FDA will mail a confirmation of the 
cancellation to the facility at the address provided in the facility's 
registration.
    (c) If an article of food is imported or offered for import into the 
United States and a foreign facility that manufactured/processed, 
packed, or held that article of food has not registered in accordance 
with this subpart, the disposition of the article of food shall be 
governed by the procedures set out in subpart I of this part.

Sec.  1.242  What does assignment of a registration number mean?

    Assignment of a registration number to a facility means that the 
facility is registered with FDA. Assignment of a registration number 
does not in any way convey FDA's approval or endorsement of a facility 
or its products.



Sec.  1.243  Is food registration information available to the public?

    (a) The list of registered facilities and registration documents 
submitted under this subpart are not subject to disclosure under 5 
U.S.C. 552 (the Freedom of Information Act). In addition, any

specific registered person, is not subject to disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552 (the Freedom of Information Act).
    (b) Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any information

is in its natural state, the country where the article of food was 
grown, including harvested or collected and readied for shipment to the 
United States. If an article of food is wild fish, including seafood 
that was caught or harvested outside the waters of the United States by 
a vessel that is not registered in the United States, the FDA Country of 
Production is the country in which the vessel is registered. If an 
article of food that is in its natural state was grown, including 
harvested or collected and readied for shipment, in a Territory, the FDA 
Country of Production is the United States.
    (ii) For an article of food that is no longer in its natural state, 
the country where the article was made; except that, if an article of 
food is made from wild fish, including seafood, aboard a vessel, the FDA 
Country of Production is the country in which the vessel is registered. 
If an article of food that is no longer in its natural state was made in 
a Territory, the FDA Country of Production is the United States.
    (5) Food has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the act, except

manufacturing/processing that consists of adding labeling or any similar 
activity of a de minimis nature. If the food undergoes further 
manufacturing/processing that exceeds an activity of a de

[[Page 30]]

minimis nature, then the subsequent facility that performed the 
additional manufacturing/processing is considered the manufacturer.
    (10) No longer in its natural state means that an article of food 
has been made from one or more ingredients or synthesized, prepared, 
treated, modified, or manipulated. Examples of activities that render

attendant to harvest or collection or treated against pests, or polished 
are still in their natural state for purposes of this subpart. Whole 
fish headed, eviscerated, or frozen attendant to harvest are still in 
their natural state for purposes of this subpart.
    (11) Port of arrival means the water, air, or land port at which the 
article of food is imported or offered for import into the United 
States. For an article of food arriving by water or air, this is the 
port of unloading. For an article of food arriving by land, this is the 
port where the article of food first crosses the border into the United 
States. The port of arrival may be different than the port where 
consumption or warehouse entry or foreign trade zone admission 
documentation is presented to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP).
    (12) Port of entry, in section 801(m) and (l) of the act (21 U.S.C.

                              Consequences



Sec.  1.283  What happens to food that is imported or offered for
import without adequate prior notice?

    (a) For each article of food that is imported or offered for import 
into the United States, except for food arriving by international mail 
or food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual, the 
consequences are:
    (1) Inadequate prior notice--(i) No prior notice. If an article of 
food arrives at the port of arrival and no prior notice has been 
submitted and confirmed by FDA for review, the food is subject to 
refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act (21 U.S.C. 
381(m)(1)). If an article of food is refused for lack of prior notice, 
unless U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) concurrence is obtained 
for export and the article is immediately exported from the port of 
arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry 
for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
    (ii) Inaccurate prior notice. If prior notice has been submitted and 
confirmed by FDA for review, but upon review of the notice or 
examination of the article of food, the notice is determined to be 
inaccurate, the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 
801(m)(1) of the act. If the article of food is refused due to 
inaccurate prior notice, unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export 
and the article is immediately exported from the port of arrival under 
CBP supervision, it must be held within the port of entry for the 
article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
    (iii) Untimely prior notice. If prior notice has been submitted and 
confirmed by FDA for review, but the full time that applies under Sec.  
1.279 for prior notice has not elapsed when the article of food arrives, 
the food is subject to refusal of admission under section 801(m)(1) of 
the act, unless FDA has already reviewed the prior notice, determined 
its response to the prior notice, and advised CBP of that response. If 
the article of food is refused due to untimely prior notice, unless CBP 
concurrence is obtained for export and the article is immediately 
exported from the port of arrival under CBP supervision, it must be held 
within the port of entry for the article unless directed by CBP or FDA.
    (2) Status and movement of refused food. (i) An article of food that 
has been refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and paragraph (a) of 
this section shall be considered general order merchandise as described 
in section 490 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).
    (ii) Refused food must be moved under appropriate custodial bond 
unless immediately exported under CBP supervision. If the food is to be 
held at the port, FDA must be notified of the location where the food is 
held at that port before the food is moved there. If the food is to be 
held at a secure facility outside the port, FDA must be notified of the 
location of the secure facility before the food is moved there. The 
refused food shall not be entered and shall not be delivered to any 
importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. If the food is to be held at a 
secure facility outside a port, the food must be taken directly to that 
secure facility.
    (3) Segregation of refused foods. If an article of food that is 
refused is part of a shipment that contains articles of food that have 
not been placed under hold or other merchandise not subject

[[Page 38]]

to this subpart, the refused article of food may be segregated from the 
rest of the shipment. This segregation must take place where the article 
is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determines 
that supervision is necessary, segregation must not take place without 
supervision.
    (4) Costs. Neither FDA nor CBP are liable for transportation, 
storage, or other expenses resulting from refusal.
    (5) Export after refusal. An article of food that has been refused 
under paragraph (a) of this section may be exported with CBP concurrence 
and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or administratively 
detained by FDA or CBP under other authority. If an article of food that 
has been refused admission under paragraph (a) of this section is 
exported, the prior notice should be cancelled within 5-business days of 
exportation.
    (6) No post-refusal submission or request for review. If an article 
of food is refused under section 801(m)(1) of the act and no prior 
notice is submitted or resubmitted, no request for FDA review is 
submitted in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, or export 
has not occurred in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section, 
the article of food shall be dealt with as set forth in CBP regulations 
relating to general order merchandise (19 CFR part 127), except that, 
unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be sold 
for export or destroyed.
    (b) Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual. If food 
carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual arriving in the 
United States is not for personal use and does not have adequate prior 
notice or the individual cannot provide FDA or CBP with a copy of the 
prior notice (PN) confirmation, the food is subject to refusal of 
admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act. If before leaving the 
port, the individual does not arrange to have the food held at the port 
or exported, FDA or CBP may destroy the article of food.
    (c) Post-Refusal prior notice submissions. (1) If an article of food 
is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section (no prior notice) 
and the food is not exported, prior notice must be submitted in 
accordance with Sec. Sec.  1.280 and 1.281(c).
    (2) If an article of food is refused under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of 
this section (inaccurate prior notice) and the food is not exported, the 
prior notice should be canceled in accordance with Sec.  1.282 and you 
must resubmit prior notice in accordance with Sec. Sec.  1.280 and 
1.281(c).
    (3) Once the prior notice has been submitted or resubmitted and 
confirmed by FDA for review, FDA will endeavor to review and respond to 
the prior notice submission within the timeframes set out in Sec.  
1.279.
    (d) FDA review after refusal. (1) If an article of food has been 
refused admission under section 801(m)(1) of the act, a request may be 
submitted asking FDA to review whether the article is subject to the 
requirements of this subpart under Sec.  1.277, or whether the 
information submitted in a prior notice is complete and accurate. A 
request for review may not be used to submit prior notice or to resubmit 
an inaccurate prior notice.
    (2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, 
importer, owner, or ultimate consignee. A request must identify which 
one the requester is.
    (3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by 
fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at http:/
/www.fda.gov--see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and 
legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one 
request for review may be submitted for each refused article.
    (4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the 
refusal. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving 
the request.
    (5) If FDA determines that the article is not subject to the 
requirements of this subpart under Sec.  1.277 or that the prior notice 
submission is complete and accurate, it will notify the requester, the 
transmitter, and CBP that the food is no longer subject to refusal under 
section 801(m)(1) of the act.
    (e) International mail. If an article of food arrives by 
international mail with inadequate prior notice or the PN confirmation 
number is not affixed as required, the parcel will be held by CBP for 72 
hours for FDA inspection and disposition. If FDA refuses the article

[[Page 39]]

under section 801(m)(1) of the act and there is a return address, the 
parcel may be returned to sender marked ``No Prior Notice--FDA 
Refused.'' If the article is refused and there is no return address or 
FDA determines that the article of food in the parcel appears to present 
a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If 
FDA does not respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the 
parcel to the sender or, if there is no return address, destroy the 
parcel, at FDA expense.
    (f) Prohibitions on delivery and transfer. (1) Notwithstanding 
section 801(b) of the act, an article of food refused under section 
801(m)(1) of the act may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or 
ultimate consignee until prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance 
with this subpart, FDA has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined 
that the prior notice is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the 
transmitter that the article of food is no longer refused admission 
under section 801(m)(1) of the act.
    (2) During the time an article of food that has been refused under 
section 801(m)(1) of the act is held, the article may not be transferred 
by any person from the port or other designated secure facility until 
prior notice is submitted to FDA in accordance with this subpart, FDA 
has examined the prior notice, FDA has determined that the prior notice 
is adequate, and FDA has notified CBP and the transmitter that the 
article of food no longer is refused admission under section 801(m)(1) 
of the act. After this notification by FDA to CBP and transmitter, entry 
may be made in accordance with law and regulation.
    (g) Relationship to other admissibility decisions. A determination 
that an article of food is no longer refused under section 801(m)(1) of 
the act is different than, and may come before, determinations of 
admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A 
determination that an article of food is no longer refused under section 
801(m)(1) of the act does not mean that it will be granted admission 
under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.



Sec.  1.284  What are the other consequences of failing to submit
adequate prior notice or otherwise failing to comply with this subpart?

    (a) The importing or offering for import into the United States of 
an article of food in violation of the requirements of section 801(m) of 
the act, including the requirements of this subpart, is a prohibited act 
under section 301(ee) of the act (21 U.S.C. 331(ee)).
    (b) Section 301 of the act prohibits the doing of certain acts or 
causing such acts to be done.
    (1) Under section 302 of the act (21 U.S.C. 332), the United States 
can bring a civil action in Federal court to enjoin persons who commit a 
prohibited act.
    (2) Under sections 301 and 303 of the act (21 U.S.C. 331 and 333), 
the United States can bring a criminal action in Federal court to 
prosecute persons who are responsible for the commission of a prohibited 
act.
    (c) Under section 306 of the act (21 U.S.C. 335a), FDA can seek 
debarment of any person who has been convicted of a felony relating to 
importation of food into the United States or any person who has engaged 
in a pattern of importing or offering for import adulterated food that 
presents a threat of serious adverse health consequences or death to 
humans or animals.



Sec.  1.285  What happens to food that is imported or offered for
import from unregistered facilities that are required to register under
subpart H of this part?

    (a) Consequences. If an article of food from a foreign facility that 
is not registered as required under section 415 of the act (21 U.S.C. 
350d) and subpart H of this part is imported or offered for import into 
the United States, the food is subject to being held under section 
801(l) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(l)).
    (b) Hold. Unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the 
article is immediately exported from the port of arrival, if an article 
of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it 
must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by 
CBP or FDA.
    (c) Status and movement of held food. (1) An article of food that 
has been

[[Page 40]]

placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act shall be considered 
general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).
    (2) Food under hold under section 801(l) of the act must be moved 
under appropriate custodial bond unless immediately exported under CBP 
supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified 
of the location where the food is held at the port before the food is 
moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the 
port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before 
the food is moved there. The food subject to hold shall not be entered 
and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate 
consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a 
port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.
    (d) Segregation of held foods. If an article of food that has been 
placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act is part of a shipment 
that contains articles that have not been placed under hold, the food 
under hold may be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This 
segregation must take place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may 
supervise segregation. If FDA or CBP determine that supervision is 
necessary, segregation must not take place without supervision.
    (e) Costs. Neither FDA nor CBP will be liable for transportation, 
storage, or other expenses resulting from any hold.
    (f) Export after hold. An article of food that has been placed under 
hold under section 801(l) of the act may be exported with CBP 
concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or 
administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority.
    (g) No registration or request for review. If an article of food is 
placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and no registration 
number or request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with 
paragraph (j) of this section or export has not occurred in accordance 
with paragraph (f) of this section, the food shall be dealt with as set 
forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise, except 
that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be 
sold for export or destroyed.
    (h) Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual. If an 
article of food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual 
arriving in the United States is not for personal use and is placed 
under hold under section 801(l) of the act because it is from a foreign 
facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act 
and subpart H of this part, the individual may arrange to have the food 
held at the port or exported. If such arrangements cannot be made, the 
article of food may be destroyed.
    (i) Post-hold submissions. (1) To resolve a hold, if an article of 
food is held under paragraph (b) of this section because it is from a 
foreign facility that is not registered, the facility must be registered 
and a registration number must be obtained.
    (2) The FDA Prior Notice Center must be notified of the applicable 
registration number in writing. The notification must provide the name 
and contact information for the person submitting the information. The 
notification may be delivered to FDA by fax or e-mail. The contact 
information for these delivery methods is listed at http://www.fda.gov--
see Prior Notice. The notification should include the applicable CBP 
entry identifier.
    (3) If FDA determines that the article is no longer subject to hold, 
it will notify the person who provided the registration information and 
CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of 
the act.
    (j) FDA review after hold. (1) If an article of food has been placed 
under hold under section 801(l) of the act, a request may be submitted 
asking FDA to review whether the facility associated with the article is 
subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act. A request for 
review may not be submitted to obtain a registration number.
    (2) A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter, 
importer, owner, or ultimate consignee of the article. A request must 
identify which one the requestor is.
    (3) A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by 
fax or

[[Page 41]]

e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at http://
www.fda.gov--see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and 
legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one 
request for review may be submitted for each article under hold.
    (4) The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the 
hold. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving 
the request.
    (5) If FDA determines that the article is not from a facility 
subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act, it will notify 
the requestor and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under 
section 801(l) of the act.
    (k) International mail. If an article of food that arrives by 
international mail is from a foreign facility that is not registered as 
required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the 
parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and 
disposition. If the article is placed under hold under section 801(l) of 
the act and there is a return address, the parcel may be returned to 
sender marked ``No Registration--No Admission Permitted.'' If the 
article is under hold and there is no return address or FDA determines 
that the article of food in the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA 
may dispose of or destroy the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not 
respond within 72 hours of the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to 
the sender marked ``No Registration--No Admission Permitted'' or, if 
there is no return address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.
    (l) Prohibitions on delivery and transfer. Notwithstanding section 
801(b) of the act, while an article of food is under hold under section 
801(l) of the act, it may not be delivered to the importer, owner, or 
ultimate consignee. If an article of food is no longer subject to hold 
under section 801(l) of the act, entry may be made in accordance with 
law and regulation.
    (m) Relationship to other admissibility provisions. A determination 
that an article of food is no longer subject to hold under section 
801(l) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations 
of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A 
determination that an article of food is no longer under hold under 
section 801(l) of the act does not mean that it will be granted 
admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.

                           General Provisions



Sec.  1.326  Who is subject to this subpart?

    (a) Persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, 
receive, hold, or import food in the United States are subject to the 
regulations in this subpart, unless you qualify for one of the 
exclusions in Sec.  1.327. If you conduct more than one type of activity 
at a location, you are required to keep records with respect to those

to keep records with respect to activities that fall within one of the 
exclusions in Sec.  1.327.
    (b) Persons subject to the regulations in this subpart must keep 
records whether or not the food is being offered for or enters 
interstate commerce.



Sec.  1.327  Who is excluded from all or part of the regulations in
this subpart?

    (a) Farms are excluded from all of the requirements in this subpart.
    (b) Restaurants are excluded from all of the requirements in this 
subpart. A restaurant/retail facility is excluded from all of the 
requirements in this subpart if its sales of food it prepares and sells 
to consumers for immediate consumption are more than 90 percent of its 
total food sales.
    (c) Fishing vessels, including those that not only harvest and 
transport fish but also engage in practices such as heading, 
eviscerating, or freezing intended solely to prepare fish for holding on 
board a harvest vessel, are excluded from all of the requirements in 
this subpart, except Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363.

[[Page 42]]

However, those fishing vessels otherwise engaged in processing fish are 
subject to all of the requirements in this subpart. For the purposes of 
this section, ``processing'' means handling, storing, preparing, 
shucking, changing into different market forms, manufacturing, 
preserving, packing, labeling, dockside unloading, holding or heading, 
eviscerating, or freezing other than solely to prepare fish for holding 
on board a harvest vessel.
    (d) Persons who distribute food directly to consumers are excluded 
from the requirements in Sec.  1.345 to establish and maintain records 
to identify the nontransporter and transporter immediate subsequent 
recipients as to those transactions. The term ``consumers'' does not 
include businesses.
    (e) Persons who operate retail food establishments that distribute 
food to persons who are not consumers are subject to all of the 
requirements in this subpart. However, the requirements in Sec.  1.345 
to establish and maintain records to identify the nontransporter and 
transporter immediate subsequent recipients that are not consumers 
applies as to those transactions only to the extent the information is 
reasonably available.
    (1) For purposes of this section, retail food establishment is 
defined to mean an establishment that sells food products directly to 
consumers as its primary function. The term ``consumers'' does not 
include businesses.
    (2) A retail food establishment may manufacture/process, pack, or 
hold food if the establishment's primary function is to sell from that 
establishment food, including food that it manufactures/processes, 
packs, or holds, directly to consumers.
    (3) A retail food establishment's primary function is to sell food 
directly to consumers if the annual monetary value of sales of food 
products directly to consumers exceeds the annual monetary value of 
sales of food products to all other buyers.
    (4) A ``retail food establishment'' includes grocery stores, 
convenience stores, and vending machine locations.
    (f) Retail food establishments that employ 10 or fewer full-time 
equivalent employees are excluded from all of the requirements in this 
subpart, except Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363. The exclusion is based on 
the number of full-time equivalent employees at each retail food 
establishment and not the entire business, which may own numerous retail 
stores.
    (g) Persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, 
receive, hold, or import food in the United States that is within the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
under the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the 
Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), or the Egg

of the requirements in this subpart with respect to that food while it 
is under the exclusive jurisdiction of USDA.
    (h) Foreign persons, except for foreign persons who transport food 
in the United States, are excluded from all of the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (i) Persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, 
receive, hold, or import food are subject to Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363 
with respect to its packaging (the outer packaging of food that bears 
the label and does not contact the food). All other persons who 
manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, receive, hold, or 
import packaging are excluded from all of the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (j) Persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, 
receive, hold, or import food contact substances other than the finished 
container that directly contacts food are excluded from all of the 
requirements of this subpart, except Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363.
    (k) Persons who place food directly in contact with its finished 
container are subject to all of the requirements of this subpart as to 
the finished container that directly contacts that food. All other 
persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, receive, 
hold, or import the finished container that directly contacts the food 
are excluded from the requirements of this subpart as to the finished 
container, except Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363.
    (l) Nonprofit food establishments are excluded from all of the 
requirements in this subpart, except Sec. Sec.  1.361 and 1.363.

[[Page 43]]

    (m) Persons who manufacture, process, pack, transport, distribute, 
receive, hold, or import food for personal consumption are excluded from 
all of the requirements of this subpart.
    (n) Persons who receive or hold food on behalf of specific 
individual consumers and who are not also parties to the transaction and 
who are not in the business of distributing food are excluded from all 
of the requirements of this subpart.



Sec.  1.328  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    The definitions of terms in section 201 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 321) apply to such terms when used 
in this subpart. In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
    Farm means:
    (1) Primary production farm. A primary production farm is an 
operation under one management in one general (but not necessarily 
contiguous) physical location devoted to the growing of crops, the 
harvesting of crops, the raising of animals (including seafood), or any 
combination of these activities. The term ``farm'' includes operations 
that, in addition to these activities:
    (i) Pack or hold raw agricultural commodities;
    (ii) Pack or hold processed food, provided that all processed food 
used in such activities is either consumed on that farm or another farm 
under the same management, or is processed food identified in paragraph 
(1)(iii)(B)(1) of this definition; and
    (iii) Manufacture/process food, provided that:
    (A) All food used in such activities is consumed on that farm or 
another farm under the same management; or
    (B) Any manufacturing/processing of food that is not consumed on 
that farm or another farm under the same management consists only of:
    (1) Drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities to create a 
distinct commodity (such as drying/dehydrating grapes to produce 
raisins), and packaging and labeling such commodities, without 
additional manufacturing/processing (an example of additional 
manufacturing/processing is slicing);
    (2) Treatment to manipulate the ripening of raw agricultural 
commodities (such as by treating produce with ethylene gas), and 
packaging and labeling treated raw agricultural commodities, without 
additional manufacturing/processing; and
    (3) Packaging and labeling raw agricultural commodities, when these 
activities do not involve additional manufacturing/processing (an 
example of additional manufacturing/processing is irradiation); or
    (2) Secondary activities farm. A secondary activities farm is an 
operation, not located on a primary production farm, devoted to 
harvesting (such as hulling or shelling), packing, and/or holding of raw 
agricultural commodities, provided that the primary production farm(s) 
that grows, harvests, and/or raises the majority of the raw agricultural 
commodities harvested, packed, and/or held by the secondary activities 
farm owns, or jointly owns, a majority interest in the secondary 
activities farm. A secondary activities farm may also conduct those 
additional activities allowed on a primary production farm as described 
in paragraphs (1)(ii) and (iii) of this definition.
    Food has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Examples of food include, but are not limited to 
fruits; vegetables; fish; dairy products; eggs; raw agricultural 
commodities for use as food or as components of food; animal feed, 
including pet food; food and feed ingredients and additives, including 
substances that migrate into food from the finished container and other 
articles that contact food; dietary supplements and dietary ingredients; 
infant formula; beverages, including alcoholic beverages and bottled 
water; live food animals; bakery goods; snack foods; candy; and canned 
foods.
    Full-time equivalent employee means all individuals employed by the 
person claiming the exemption. The number of full-time equivalent 
employees is determined by dividing the total number of hours of salary 
or wages paid directly to employees of the person and of all of its 
affiliates by the number of hours of work in 1 year, 2,080 hours (i.e., 
40 hours x 52 weeks).

[[Page 44]]

    Harvesting applies to farms and farm mixed-type facilities and means 
activities that are traditionally performed on farms for the purpose of 
removing raw agricultural commodities from the place they were grown or 
raised and preparing them for use as food. Harvesting is limited to 
activities performed on raw agricultural commodities, or on processed 
foods created by drying/dehydrating a raw agricultural commodity without 
additional manufacturing/processing, on a farm. Harvesting does not 
include activities that transform a raw agricultural commodity into a 
processed food as defined in section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act. Examples of harvesting include cutting (or otherwise 
separating) the edible portion of the raw agricultural commodity from 
the crop plant and removing or trimming part of the raw agricultural 
commodity (e.g., foliage, husks, roots, or stems). Examples of 
harvesting also include cooling, field coring, filtering, gathering, 
hulling, shelling, sifting, threshing, trimming of outer leaves of, and 
washing raw agricultural commodities grown on a farm.
    Holding means storage of food and also includes activities performed 
incidental to storage of a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe 
or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during 
storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the 
drying/dehydrating does not create a distinct commodity (such as drying/
dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed 
as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as 
blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down 
pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 
201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities 
could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain 
elevators, and liquid storage tanks.
    Manufacturing/processing means making food from one or more 
ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying or 
manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of 
manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, 
canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw 
agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/
dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, 
extracting juice, formulating, freezing, grinding, homogenizing, 
irradiating, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging (including modified 
atmosphere packaging), pasteurizing, peeling, rendering, treating to 
manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm 
mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include 
activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
    Mixed-type facility means an establishment that engages in both 
activities that are exempt from registration under section 415 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and activities that require the 
establishment to be registered. An example of such a facility is a 
``farm mixed-type facility,'' which is an establishment that is a farm, 
but also conducts activities outside the farm definition that require 
the establishment to be registered.
    Nonprofit food establishment means a charitable entity that prepares 
or serves food directly to the consumer or otherwise provides food or 
meals for consumption by humans or animals in the United States. The 
term includes central food banks, soup kitchens, and nonprofit food 
delivery services. To be considered a nonprofit food establishment, the 
establishment must meet the terms of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).
    Nontransporter means a person who owns food or who holds, 
manufactures, processes, packs, imports, receives, or distributes food 
for purposes other than transportation.
    Nontransporter immediate previous source means a person that last 
had food before transferring it to another nontransporter.
    Nontransporter immediate subsequent recipient means a nontransporter 
that acquires food from another nontransporter.
    Packaging (when used as a noun) means the outer packaging of food 
that bears the label and does not contact

[[Page 45]]

the food. Packaging does not include food contact substances as they are 
defined in section 409(h)(6) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act.
    Packaging (when used as a verb) means placing food into a container 
that directly contacts the food and that the consumer receives.
    Packing means placing food into a container other than packaging the 
food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to 
packing or re-packing a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe or 
effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, 
grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-
packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity, as defined in section 201(r) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, into a processed food as defined in 
section 201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    Person includes individual, partnership, corporation, and 
association.
    Recipe means the formula, including ingredients, quantities, and 
instructions, necessary to manufacture a food product. Because a recipe 
must have all three elements, a list of the ingredients used to 
manufacture a product without quantity information and manufacturing 
instructions is not a recipe.
    Restaurant means a facility that prepares and sells food directly to 
consumers for immediate consumption. ``Restaurant'' does not include 
facilities that provide food to interstate conveyances, central 
kitchens, and other similar facilities that do not prepare and serve 
food directly to consumers.
    (1) Facilities in which food is directly provided to humans, such as 
cafeterias, lunchrooms, cafes, bistros, fast food establishments, food 
stands, saloons, taverns, bars, lounges, catering facilities, hospital 
kitchens, day care kitchens, and nursing home kitchens, are restaurants.
    (2) Pet shelters, kennels, and veterinary facilities in which food 
is directly provided to animals are restaurants.
    Transporter means a person who has possession, custody, or control 
of an article of food in the United States for the sole purpose of 
transporting the food, whether by road, rail, water, or air. Transporter 
also includes a foreign person that transports food in the United 
States, regardless of whether that foreign person has possession, 
custody, or control of that food for the sole purpose of transporting 
that food.
    Transporter's immediate previous source means a person from whom a 
transporter received food. This source can be either another transporter 
or a nontransporter.
    Transporter's immediate subsequent recipient means a person to whom 
a transporter delivered food. This recipient can be either another 
transporter or a nontransporter.
    You means a person subject to this subpart under Sec.  1.326.

[69 FR 71651, Dec. 9, 2004, as amended at 80 FR 56143, Sept. 17, 2015; 
81 FR 3715, Jan. 22, 2016]



Sec.  1.329  Do other statutory provisions and regulations apply?

    (a) In addition to the regulations in this subpart, you must comply 
with all other applicable statutory provisions and regulations related 
to the establishment and maintenance of records for foods except as 
described in paragraph (b) of this section. For example, the regulations 
in this subpart are in addition to existing recordkeeping regulations 
for low acid canned foods, juice, seafood, infant formula, color 
additives, bottled water, animal feed, and medicated animal feed.
    (b) Records established or maintained to satisfy the requirements of 
this subpart that meet the definition of electronic records in Sec.  
11.3(b)(6) (21 CFR 11.3 (b)(6)) of this chapter are exempt from the 
requirements of part 11 of this chapter. Records that satisfy the 
requirements of this subpart but that are also required under other 
applicable statutory provisions or regulations remain subject to part 11 
of this chapter.



Sec.  1.330  Can existing records satisfy the requirements of 
this subpart?

    The regulations in this subpart do not require duplication of 
existing records if those records contain all of the information 
required by this subpart. If a covered person keeps records of all of 
the information as required by

[[Page 46]]

this subpart to comply with other Federal, State, or local regulations, 
or for any other reason, then those records may be used to meet these 
requirements. Moreover, persons do not have to keep all of the 
information required by this rule in one set of records. If they have 
records containing some of the required information, they may keep those 
existing records and keep, either separately or in a combined form, any 
new information required by this rule. There is no obligation to create 
an entirely new record or compilation of records containing both 
existing and new information, even if the records containing some of the 
required information were not created at the time the food was received 
or released.

 Requirements for Nontransporters To Establish and Maintain Records To 
 Identify the Nontransporter and Transporter Immediate Previous Sources 
                                 of Food



Sec.  1.337  What information must nontransporters establish and
maintain to identify the nontransporter and transporter immediate previous
sources of food?

    (a) If you are a nontransporter, you must establish and maintain the 
following records for all food you receive:
    (1) The name of the firm, address, telephone number and, if 
available, the fax number and e-mail address of the nontransporter 
immediate previous source, whether domestic or foreign;
    (2) An adequate description of the type of food received, to include 
brand name and specific variety (e.g., brand x cheddar cheese, not just 
cheese; or romaine lettuce, not just lettuce);
    (3) The date you received the food;
    (4) For persons who manufacture, process, or pack food, the lot or 
code number or other identifier of the food (to the extent this 
information exists);
    (5) The quantity and how the food is packaged (e.g., 6 count 
bunches, 25 pound (lb) carton, 12 ounce (oz) bottle, 100 gallon (gal) 
tank); and
    (6) The name of the firm, address, telephone number, and, if 
available, the fax number and e-mail address of the transporter 
immediate previous source (the transporter who transported the food to 
you).

 Requirements for Nontransporters To Establish and Maintain Records To 
    Identify the Nontransporter and Transporter Immediate Subsequent 
                           Recipients of Food



Sec.  1.345  What information must nontransporters establish and 
maintain to identify the nontransporter and transporter immediate 
subsequent recipients of food?

    (a) If you are a nontransporter, you must establish and maintain the 
following records for food you release:
    (1) The name of the firm, address, telephone number, and, if

request to modify a detention order to permit movement of a detained 
article of food for any of the following purposes:

of food, or
    (4) For any other purpose that the authorized FDA representative

any applicable conditions described in the detention order. If you

[[Page 51]]

are requesting modification of a detention order for the purpose of 
destroying the detained article of food, you also must submit a verified 
statement identifying the ownership or proprietary interest you have in 
the detained article of food, in accordance with Supplemental Rule C to 
the ``Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.''

during, and after the transfer. FDA will state any conditions of 
transportation applicable to the detained article. You may not transfer 
a detained article of food without FDA supervision unless FDA has 
declined in writing to supervise the transfer. If FDA has declined in 
writing to supervise the transfer of a detained article, you must 
immediately notify in writing the authorized FDA representative who 
approved the modification of the detention order that the article of 
food has reached its new location, and the specific location of the 
detained article within the new location. Such written notification may 
be in the form of a fax, e-mail, or other form as agreed to by the 
authorized FDA representative.

against a perishable food subject to a detention order under this 
subpart, FDA will send the seizure recommendation to the Department of 
Justice (DOJ) within 4 calendar days after the detention order is 
issued, unless extenuating circumstances exist. If the fourth calendar 
day is not a working day, FDA will advise the DOJ of its plans to 
recommend a seizure action on the last working day before the fourth 
calendar day and send the recommendation as soon as practicable on the 
first working day that follows. For purposes of this section, an 
extenuating circumstance includes, but is not limited to, instances when 
the results of confirmatory testing or other evidentiary development 
requires more than 4 calendar days to complete.



Sec.  1.384  When does a detention order terminate?

    If FDA terminates a detention order or the detention period expires, 
an authorized FDA representative will issue a detention termination 
notice releasing the article of food to any person who received the 
detention order or that person's representative and will remove, or 
authorize in writing the removal of, the required labels or tags. If

food if the owner's identity can be determined readily.
    (b) If FDA issues a detention order for an article of food located 
in a vehicle or other carrier used to transport the detained article of

detention order, FDA must conduct the hearing in accordance with part 16 
of this chapter, except that:

describes the FDA employees, e.g., Regional Food and Drug Directors or 
other officials senior to a District Director, who preside at hearings 
under this subpart;
    (g) The presiding officer may require that a hearing conducted under 
this section be completed within 1 calendar day, as appropriate;
    (h) Section 16.60(e) and (f) of this chapter does not apply to a 
hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer must prepare a written 
report of the hearing. All written material presented at the hearing 
will be attached to the report. The presiding officer must include as 
part of the report of the hearing a finding on the credibility of 
witnesses (other than expert witnesses) whenever credibility is a 
material issue, and must include a proposed decision, with a statement 
of reasons. The hearing participant may review and comment on the 
presiding officer's report within 4 hours of issuance of the report. The 
presiding officer will then issue the final agency decision.

[[Page 54]]

    (i) Section 16.80(a)(4) of this chapter does not apply to a 
regulatory hearing under this subpart. The presiding officer's report of 
the hearing and any comments on the report by the hearing participant 
under Sec.  1.403(h) are part of the administrative record.
    (j) No party shall have the right, under Sec.  16.119 of this 
chapter to petition the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for 
reconsideration or a stay of the presiding officer's final agency 
decision.
    (k) If FDA grants a request for an informal hearing on an appeal of 
a detention order, the hearing must be conducted as a regulatory hearing 
pursuant to regulation in accordance with part 16 of this chapter, 
except that Sec.  16.95(b) does not apply to a hearing under this 
subpart. With respect to a regulatory hearing under this subpart, the 
administrative record of the hearing specified in Sec. Sec.  
16.80(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(5), and 1.403(i) constitutes the 
exclusive record for the presiding officer's final decision on an 
administrative detention. For purposes of judicial review under Sec.  
10.45 of this chapter, the record of the administrative proceeding 
consists of the record of the hearing and the presiding officer's final 
decision.



Sec.  1.404  Who serves as the presiding officer for an appeal, and
for an informal hearing?

    The presiding officer for an appeal, and for an informal hearing, 
must be an FDA Regional Food and Drug Director or another FDA official 
senior to an FDA District Director.



Sec.  1.405  When does FDA have to issue a decision on an appeal?

    (a) The presiding officer must issue a written report that includes 
a proposed decision confirming or revoking the detention by noon on the 
fifth calendar day after the appeal is filed; after your 4 hour 
opportunity for submitting comments under Sec.  1.403(h), the presiding 
officer must issue a final decision within the 5-calendar day period 
after the appeal is filed. If FDA either fails to provide you with an 
opportunity to request an informal hearing, or fails to confirm or 
terminate the detention order within the 5-calendar day period, the 
detention order is deemed terminated.
    (b) If you appeal the detention order, but do not request an 
informal hearing, the presiding officer must issue a decision on the 
appeal confirming or revoking the detention within 5 calendar days after 
the date the appeal is filed. If the presiding officer fails to confirm 
or terminate the detention order during such 5-calendar day period, the 
detention order is deemed terminated.
    (c) If you appeal the detention order and request an informal 
hearing and your hearing request is denied, the presiding officer must 
issue a decision on the appeal confirming or revoking the detention 
within 5 calendar days after the date the appeal is filed. If the 
presiding officer fails to confirm or terminate the detention order 
during such 5-calendar day period, the detention order is deemed 
terminated.
    (d) If the presiding officer confirms a detention order, the article 
of food continues to be detained until we terminate the detention under 
Sec.  1.384 or the detention period expires under Sec.  1.379, whichever 
occurs first.
    (e) If the presiding officer terminates a detention order, or the 
detention period expires, FDA must terminate the detention order as 
specified under Sec.  1.384.
    (f) Confirmation of a detention order by the presiding officer is 
considered a final agency action for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 702.



Sec.  1.406  How will FDA handle classified information in an 
informal hearing?

    Where the credible evidence or information supporting the detention 
order is classified under the applicable Executive order as requiring 
protection from unauthorized disclosure in the interest of national 
security (``classified information''), FDA will not provide you with 
this information. The presiding officer will give you notice of the 
general nature of the information and an opportunity to offer opposing 
evidence or information, if he or she may do so consistently with 
safeguarding the information and its source. If classified information 
was used to support the detention, then any confirmation of such 
detention will

[[Page 55]]

state whether it is based in whole or in part on that classified 
information.

hazard for which a person knowledgeable about the safe manufacturing, 
processing, packing, or holding of food would, based on the outcome of a 
hazard analysis (which includes an assessment of the probability that 
the hazard will occur in the absence of controls or measures and the 
severity of the illness or injury if the hazard were to occur), 
establish one or more controls or measures to significantly minimize or 
prevent the hazard in a food and components to manage those controls or 
measures (such as monitoring, corrections or corrective actions, 
verification, and records) as appropriate to the food, the facility, and 
the nature of the control or measure and its role in the facility's food 
safety system.
    Holding means storage of food and also includes activities performed 
incidental to storage of a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe 
or effective storage of that food, such as fumigating food during 
storage, and drying/dehydrating raw agricultural commodities when the

dehydrating hay or alfalfa)). Holding also includes activities performed 
as a practical necessity for the distribution of that food (such as 
blending of the same raw agricultural commodity and breaking down 
pallets), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 
201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Holding facilities 
could include warehouses, cold storage facilities, storage silos, grain 
elevators, and liquid storage tanks.

by an establishment's specific code.
    Manufacturing/processing means making food from one or more 
ingredients, or synthesizing, preparing, treating, modifying, or 
manipulating food, including food crops or ingredients. Examples of 
manufacturing/processing activities include: Baking, boiling, bottling, 
canning, cooking, cooling, cutting, distilling, drying/dehydrating raw 
agricultural commodities to create a distinct commodity (such as drying/
dehydrating grapes to produce raisins), evaporating, eviscerating, 
extracting juice, extruding (of animal food), formulating, freezing, 
grinding, homogenizing, labeling, milling, mixing, packaging, 
pasteurizing, peeling, pelleting (of animal food), rendering, treating 
to manipulate ripening, trimming, washing, or waxing. For farms and farm 
mixed-type facilities, manufacturing/processing does not include 
activities that are part of harvesting, packing, or holding.
    Microorganisms means yeasts, molds, bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and 
microscopic parasites and includes species that are pathogens.
    Packing means placing food into a container other than packaging the 
food and also includes re-packing and activities performed incidental to

[[Page 57]]

packing or re-packing a food (e.g., activities performed for the safe or 
effective packing or re-packing of that food (such as sorting, culling, 
grading, and weighing or conveying incidental to packing or re-
packing)), but does not include activities that transform a raw 
agricultural commodity into a processed food as defined in section 
201(gg) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    Pathogen means a microorganism of public health significance.
    Qualified auditor means a person who is a qualified individual as 
defined in this section and has technical expertise obtained through 
education, training, or experience (or a combination thereof) necessary 
to perform the auditing function as required by Sec.  1.506(e)(1)(i) or

accordance with subpart M of this part.
    Qualified individual means a person who has the education, training, 
or experience (or a combination thereof) necessary to perform an 
activity required under this subpart, and can read and understand the 
language of any records that the person must review in performing this 
activity. A qualified individual may be, but is not required to be, an 
employee of the importer. A government employee, including a foreign 
government employee, may be a qualified individual.
    Raw agricultural commodity has the meaning given in section 201(r) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    Ready-to-eat food (RTE food) means any food that is normally eaten 
in its raw state or any food, including a processed food, for which it 
is reasonably foreseeable that the food will be eaten without further 
processing that would significantly minimize biological hazards.
    Receiving facility means a facility that is subject to subparts C 
and G of part 117 of this chapter, or subparts C and E of part 507 of 
this chapter, and that manufactures/processes a raw material or other

qualified individual must have the education, training, or experience 
(or a combination thereof) necessary to perform

[[Page 60]]

their assigned activities and must be able to read and understand the 
language of any records that must be reviewed in performing an activity.
    (b) Qualified auditor. A qualified auditor must conduct any audit 
conducted in accordance with Sec.  1.506(e)(1)(i) or Sec.  
1.511(c)(5)(i)(A). A qualified auditor must have technical expertise 
obtained through education, training, or experience (or a combination 
thereof) necessary to perform the auditing function.



Sec.  1.504  What hazard analysis must I conduct?

    (a) Requirement for a hazard analysis. Except as specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section, you must conduct a hazard analysis to 
identify and evaluate, based on experience, illness data, scientific 
reports, and other information, known or reasonably foreseeable hazards 
for each type of food you import to determine whether there are any 
hazards requiring a control. Your hazard analysis must be written 
regardless of its outcome.
    (b) Hazard identification. (1) Your analysis of the known or 
reasonably foreseeable hazards in each food must include the following 
types of hazards:
    (i) Biological hazards, including microbiological hazards such as 
parasites, environmental pathogens, and other pathogens;
    (ii) Chemical hazards, including radiological hazards, pesticide and 
drug residues, natural toxins, decomposition, unapproved food or color 
additives, food allergens, and (in animal food) nutrient deficiencies or 
toxicities; and
    (iii) Physical hazards (such as stones, glass, and metal fragments).
    (2) Your analysis must include known or reasonably foreseeable 
hazards that may be present in a food for any of the following reasons:
    (i) The hazard occurs naturally;
    (ii) The hazard may be unintentionally introduced; or
    (iii) The hazard may be intentionally introduced for purposes of 
economic gain.
    (c) Hazard evaluation. (1) Your hazard analysis must include an 
evaluation of the hazards identified in paragraph (b) of this section to 
assess the probability that the hazard will occur in the absence of 
controls and the severity of the illness or injury if the hazard were to 
occur.
    (2) The hazard evaluation required by paragraph (c)(1) of this 
section must include an evaluation of environmental pathogens whenever a 
ready-to-eat food is exposed to the environment before packaging and the 
packaged food does not receive a treatment or otherwise include a 
control or measure (such as a formulation lethal to the pathogen) that 
would significantly minimize the pathogen.
    (3) Your hazard evaluation must consider the effect of the following 
on the safety of the finished food for the intended consumer:
    (i) The formulation of the food;
    (ii) The condition, function, and design of the establishment and 
equipment of a typical entity that manufactures/processes, grows, 
harvests, or raises this type of food;
    (iii) Raw materials and other ingredients;
    (iv) Transportation practices;
    (v) Harvesting, raising, manufacturing, processing, and packing 
procedures;
    (vi) Packaging and labeling activities;
    (vii) Storage and distribution;
    (viii) Intended or reasonably foreseeable use;
    (ix) Sanitation, including employee hygiene; and
    (x) Any other relevant factors, such as the temporal (e.g., weather-
related) nature of some hazards (e.g., levels of natural toxins).
    (d) Review of another entity's hazard analysis. If another entity 
(including your foreign supplier) has, using a qualified individual, 
analyzed the known or reasonably foreseeable hazards for the food to 
determine whether there are any hazards requiring a control, you may 
meet your requirement to determine whether there are any hazards 
requiring a control in a food by reviewing and assessing the hazard 
analysis conducted by that entity. You must document your review and 
assessment of that hazard analysis, including documenting that the 
hazard analysis was conducted by a qualified individual.

[[Page 61]]

    (e) Hazards in raw agricultural commodities that are fruits or 
vegetables. If you are importing a raw agricultural commodity that is a 
fruit or vegetable that is ``covered produce'' as defined in Sec.  112.3 
of this chapter, you are not required to determine whether there are any 
biological hazards requiring a control in such food because the 
biological hazards in such fruits or vegetables require a control and 
compliance with the requirements in part 112 of this chapter 
significantly minimizes or prevents the biological hazards. However, you 
must determine whether there are any other types of hazards requiring a 
control in such food.
    (f) No hazards requiring a control. If you evaluate the known and 
reasonably foreseeable hazards in a food and determine that there are no 
hazards requiring a control, you are not required to conduct an 
evaluation for foreign supplier approval and verification under Sec.  
1.505 and you are not required to conduct foreign supplier verification 
activities under Sec.  1.506. This paragraph (f) does not apply if the 
food is a raw agricultural commodity that is a fruit or vegetable that 
is ``covered produce'' as defined in Sec.  112.3 of this chapter.



Sec.  1.505  What evaluation for foreign supplier approval and
verification must I conduct?

    (a) Evaluation of a foreign supplier's performance and the risk 
posed by a food. (1) Except as specified in paragraphs (d) and (e) of 
this section, in approving your foreign suppliers and determining the 
appropriate supplier verification activities that must be conducted for 
a foreign supplier of a type of food you import, you must consider the 
following:
    (i) The hazard analysis of the food conducted in accordance with 
Sec.  1.504, including the nature of the hazard requiring a control.
    (ii) The entity or entities that will be significantly minimizing or 
preventing the hazards requiring a control or verifying that such 
hazards have been significantly minimized or prevented, such as the 
foreign supplier, the foreign supplier's raw material or other 
ingredient supplier, or another entity in your supply chain.
    (iii) Foreign supplier performance, including:
    (A) The foreign supplier's procedures, processes, and practices 
related to the safety of the food;
    (B) Applicable FDA food safety regulations and information relevant 
to the foreign supplier's compliance with those regulations, including 
whether the foreign supplier is the subject of an FDA warning letter, 
import alert, or other FDA compliance action related to food safety (or, 
when applicable, the relevant laws and regulations of a country whose 
food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or 
determined to be equivalent to that of the United States, and 
information relevant to the supplier's compliance with those laws and 
regulations); and
    (C) The foreign supplier's food safety history, including available 
information about results from testing foods for hazards, audit results 
relating to the safety of the food, and responsiveness of the foreign 
supplier in correcting problems.
    (iv) Any other factors as appropriate and necessary, such as storage 
and transportation practices.
    (2) You must document the evaluation you conduct under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section.
    (b) Approval of foreign suppliers. You must approve your foreign 
suppliers on the basis of the evaluation that you conducted under 
paragraph (a) of this section or that you review and assess under 
paragraph (d) of this section, and document your approval.
    (c) Reevaluation of a foreign supplier's performance and the risk 
posed by a food. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (d) of this 
section, you must promptly reevaluate the concerns associated with the 
factors in paragraph (a)(1) of this section when you become aware of new 
information about these factors, and the reevaluation must be 
documented. If you determine that the concerns associated with importing 
a food from a foreign supplier have changed, you must promptly determine 
(and document) whether it is appropriate to continue to import the food 
from the foreign supplier and whether the supplier verification 
activities conducted under Sec.  1.506 or Sec.  1.511(c) need to be 
changed.

[[Page 62]]

    (2) If at the end of any 3-year period you have not reevaluated the 
concerns associated with the factors in paragraph (a)(1) of this section 
in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, you must reevaluate 
those concerns and take other appropriate actions, if necessary, in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1). You must document your reevaluation 
and any subsequent actions you take in accordance with paragraph (c)(1).
    (d) Review of another entity's evaluation or reevaluation of a 
foreign supplier's performance and the risk posed by a food. If an 
entity other than the foreign supplier has, using a qualified 
individual, performed the evaluation described in paragraph (a) of this 
section or the reevaluation described in paragraph (c) of this section, 
you may meet the requirements of the applicable paragraph by reviewing 
and assessing the evaluation or reevaluation conducted by that entity. 
You must document your review and assessment, including documenting that 
the evaluation or reevaluation was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (e) Inapplicability to certain circumstances. You are not required 
to conduct an evaluation under this section or to conduct foreign 
supplier verification activities under Sec.  1.506 if one of the 
circumstances described in Sec.  1.507 applies to your importation of a 
food and you are in compliance with that section.



Sec.  1.506  What foreign supplier verification and related activities
must I conduct?

    (a) Use of approved foreign suppliers. (1) You must establish and 
follow written procedures to ensure that you import foods only from 
foreign suppliers you have approved based on the evaluation conducted 
under Sec.  1.505 (or, when necessary and appropriate, on a temporary 
basis from unapproved foreign suppliers whose foods you subject to 
adequate verification activities before importing the food). You must 
document your use of these procedures.
    (2) You may rely on an entity other than your foreign supplier to 
establish the procedures and perform and document the activities 
required under paragraph (a)(1) of this section provided that you review 
and assess that entity's documentation of the procedures and activities, 
and you document your review and assessment.
    (b) Foreign supplier verification procedures. You must establish and 
follow adequate written procedures for ensuring that appropriate foreign 
supplier verification activities are conducted with respect to the foods 
you import.
    (c) Requirement of supplier verification. The foreign supplier 
verification activities must provide assurance that the hazards 
requiring a control in the food you import have been significantly 
minimized or prevented.
    (d) Determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification 
activities--(1)(i) General. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(3) of this section, before importing a food from a foreign supplier, 
you must determine and document which verification activity or 
activities listed in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(A) through (D) of this 
section, as well as the frequency with which the activity or activities 
must be conducted, are needed to provide adequate assurances that the 
food you obtain from the foreign supplier is produced in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. Verification activities must address the 
entity or entities that are significantly minimizing or preventing the 
hazards or verifying that the hazards have been significantly minimized 
or prevented (e.g., when an entity other than the grower of produce 
subject to part 112 of this chapter harvests or packs the produce and 
significantly minimizes or prevents the hazard or verifies that the 
hazard has been significantly minimized or prevented, or when the 
foreign supplier's raw material supplier significantly minimizes or 
prevents a hazard). The determination of appropriate supplier 
verification activities must be based on the evaluation of the food and 
foreign supplier conducted under Sec.  1.505.
    (ii) Appropriate verification activities. The following are 
appropriate supplier verification activities:
    (A) Onsite audits as specified in paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this 
section;
    (B) Sampling and testing of a food as specified in paragraph 
(e)(1)(ii) of this section;

[[Page 63]]

    (C) Review of the foreign supplier's relevant food safety records as 
specified in paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section; and
    (D) Other appropriate supplier verification activities as specified 
in paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (2) Verification activities for certain serious hazards. When a 
hazard in a food will be controlled by the foreign supplier and is one 
for which there is a reasonable probability that exposure to the hazard 
will result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or 
animals, you must conduct or obtain documentation of an onsite audit of 
the foreign supplier before initially importing the food and at least 
annually thereafter, unless you make an adequate written determination 
that, instead of such initial and annual onsite auditing, other supplier 
verification activities listed in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section 
and/or less frequent onsite auditing are appropriate to provide adequate 
assurances that the foreign supplier is producing the food in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section, based on the determination made 
under Sec.  1.505.
    (3) Reliance on a determination by another entity. You may rely on a 
determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(1) or (2) of this section made by an 
entity other than the foreign supplier if you review and assess whether 
the entity's determination regarding appropriate activities (including 
the frequency with which such activities must be conducted) is 
appropriate. You must document your review and assessment, including 
documenting that the determination of appropriate verification 
activities was made by a qualified individual.
    (e) Performance of foreign supplier verification activities--(1) 
Verification activities. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this 
section, based on the determination made in accordance with paragraph 
(d) of this section, you must conduct (and document) or obtain 
documentation of one or more of the supplier verification activities 
listed in paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section for each 
foreign supplier before importing the food and periodically thereafter.
    (i) Onsite audit of the foreign supplier. (A) An onsite audit of a 
foreign supplier must be performed by a qualified auditor.
    (B) If the food is subject to one or more FDA food safety 
regulations, an onsite audit of the foreign supplier must consider such 
regulations and include a review of the supplier's written food safety 
plan, if any, and its implementation, for the hazard being controlled 
(or, when applicable, an onsite audit may consider relevant laws and 
regulations of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially 
recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the 
United States).
    (C) If the onsite audit is conducted solely to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (e) of this section by an audit agent of a certification 
body that is accredited in accordance with subpart M of this part, the 
audit is not subject to the requirements in that subpart.
    (D) You must retain documentation of each onsite audit, including 
the audit procedures, the dates the audit was conducted, the conclusions 
of the audit, any corrective actions taken in response to significant 
deficiencies identified during the audit, and documentation that the 
audit was conducted by a qualified auditor.
    (E) The following inspection results may be substituted for an 
onsite audit, provided that the inspection was conducted within 1 year 
of the date by which the onsite audit would have been required to be 
conducted:
    (1) The written results of an appropriate inspection of the foreign 
supplier for compliance with applicable FDA food safety regulations 
conducted by FDA, representatives of other Federal Agencies (such as the 
USDA), or representatives of State, local, tribal, or territorial 
agencies; or
    (2) The written results of an inspection of the foreign supplier by 
the food safety authority of a country whose food safety system FDA has 
officially recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to 
that of the United States, provided that the food that is the subject of 
the onsite audit is within the scope of the official recognition or 
equivalence determination,

[[Page 64]]

and the foreign supplier is in, and under the regulatory oversight of, 
such country.
    (ii) Sampling and testing of the food. You must retain documentation 
of each sampling and testing of a food, including identification of the 
food tested (including lot number, as appropriate), the number of 
samples tested, the test(s) conducted (including the analytical 
method(s) used), the date(s) on which the test(s) were conducted and the 
date of the report of the testing, the results of the testing, any 
corrective actions taken in response to detection of hazards, 
information identifying the laboratory conducting the testing, and 
documentation that the testing was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (iii) Review of the foreign supplier's relevant food safety records. 
You must retain documentation of each record review, including the 
date(s) of review, the general nature of the records reviewed, the 
conclusions of the review, any corrective actions taken in response to 
significant deficiencies identified during the review, and documentation 
that the review was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (iv) Other appropriate activity. (A) You may conduct (and document) 
or obtain documentation of other supplier verification activities that 
are appropriate based on foreign supplier performance and the risk 
associated with the food.
    (B) You must retain documentation of each activity conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of this section, including a 
description of the activity, the date on which it was conducted, the 
findings or results of the activity, any corrective actions taken in 
response to significant deficiencies identified, and documentation that 
the activity was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (2) Reliance upon performance of activities by other entities. (i) 
Except as specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, you may 
rely on supplier verification activities conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section by another entity provided that you 
review and assess the results of these activities in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
    (ii) You may not rely on the foreign supplier itself or employees of 
the foreign supplier to perform supplier verification activities, except 
with respect to sampling and testing of food in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section.
    (3) Review of results of verification activities. You must promptly 
review and assess the results of the verification activities that you 
conduct or obtain documentation of under paragraph (e)(1) of this 
section, or that are conducted by other entities in accordance with 
paragraph (e)(2) of this section. You must document your review and 
assessment of the results of verification activities. If the results do 
not provide adequate assurances that the hazards requiring a control in 
the food you obtain from the foreign supplier have been significantly 
minimized or prevented, you must take appropriate action in accordance 
with Sec.  1.508(a). You are not required to retain documentation of 
supplier verification activities conducted by other entities, provided 
that you can obtain the documentation and make it available to FDA in 
accordance with Sec.  1.510(b).
    (4) Independence of qualified individuals conducting verification 
activities. There must not be any financial conflicts of interests that 
influence the results of the verification activities set forth in 
paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and payment must not be related to the 
results of the activity.



Sec.  1.507  What requirements apply when I import a food that cannot
be consumed without the hazards being controlled or for which the
hazards are controlled after importation?

    (a) Circumstances. You are not required to conduct an evaluation of 
a food and foreign supplier under Sec.  1.505 or supplier verification 
activities under Sec.  1.506 when you identify a hazard requiring a 
control (identified hazard) in a food and any of the following 
circumstances apply:
    (1) You determine and document that the type of food (e.g., raw 
agricultural commodities such as cocoa beans and coffee beans) could not 
be consumed without application of an appropriate control;

[[Page 65]]

    (2) You rely on your customer who is subject to the requirements for 
hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls in subpart C of part 
117 or subpart C of part 507 of this chapter to ensure that the 
identified hazard will be significantly minimized or prevented and you:
    (i) Disclose in documents accompanying the food, in accordance with 
the practice of the trade, that the food is ``not processed to control 
[identified hazard]''; and
    (ii) Annually obtain from your customer written assurance, subject 
to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, that the customer 
has established and is following procedures (identified in the written 
assurance) that will significantly minimize or prevent the identified 
hazard;
    (3) You rely on your customer who is not subject to the requirements 
for hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls in subpart C of 
part 117 or subpart C of part 507 of this chapter to provide assurance 
it is manufacturing, processing, or preparing the food in accordance 
with the applicable food safety requirements and you:
    (i) Disclose in documents accompanying the food, in accordance with 
the practice of the trade, that the food is ``not processed to control 
[identified hazard]''; and
    (ii) Annually obtain from your customer written assurance that it is 
manufacturing, processing, or preparing the food in accordance with 
applicable food safety requirements;
    (4) You rely on your customer to provide assurance that the food 
will be processed to control the identified hazard by an entity in the 
distribution chain subsequent to the customer and you:
    (i) Disclose in documents accompanying the food, in accordance with 
the practice of the trade, that the food is ``not processed to control 
[identified hazard]''; and
    (ii) Annually obtain from your customer written assurance, subject 
to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, that your 
customer:
    (A) Will disclose in documents accompanying the food, in accordance 
with the practice of the trade, that the food is ``not processed to 
control [identified hazard]''; and
    (B) Will only sell the food to another entity that agrees, in 
writing, it will:
    (1) Follow procedures (identified in a written assurance) that will 
significantly minimize or prevent the identified hazard (if the entity 
is subject to the requirements for hazard analysis and risk-based 
preventive controls in subpart C of part 117 or subpart C of part 507 of 
this chapter) or manufacture, process, or prepare the food in accordance 
with applicable food safety requirements (if the entity is not subject 
to the requirements for hazard analysis and risk-based preventive 
controls in subpart C of part 117 or subpart C of part 507); or
    (2) Obtain a similar written assurance from the entity's customer, 
subject to the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, as in 
paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section, as appropriate; or
    (5) You have established, documented, and implemented a system that 
ensures control, at a subsequent distribution step, of the hazards in 
the food you distribute and you document your implementation of that 
system.
    (b) Written assurances. Any written assurances required under this 
section must contain the following:
    (1) Effective date;
    (2) Printed names and signatures of authorized officials; and
    (3) The assurance specified in the applicable paragraph.

in the distribution chain for a food that provides a written assurance 
under paragraph (a)(2), (3), or (4) of this section must act 
consistently with the assurance and document its actions taken to 
satisfy the written assurance.



Sec.  1.508  What corrective actions must I take under my FSVP?

    (a) You must promptly take appropriate corrective actions if you 
determine that a foreign supplier of food you import does not produce 
the food in compliance with processes and procedures that provide at 
least the same level of public health protection as those required under 
section 418 or 419

[[Page 66]]

of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, if either is applicable, 
and the implementing regulations, or produces food that is adulterated 
under section 402 or misbranded under section 403(w) (if applicable) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. This determination could be 
based on a review of consumer, customer, or other complaints related to 
food safety, the verification activities conducted under Sec.  1.506 or 
Sec.  1.511(c), a reevaluation of the risks posed by the food and the 
foreign supplier's performance conducted under Sec.  1.505(c) or (d), or 
any other relevant information you obtain. The appropriate corrective 
actions will depend on the circumstances but could include discontinuing 
use of the foreign supplier until the cause or causes of noncompliance, 
adulteration, or misbranding have been adequately addressed. You must 
document any corrective actions you take in accordance with this 
paragraph.
    (b) If you determine, by means other than the verification 
activities conducted under Sec.  1.506 or Sec.  1.511(c) or a 
reevaluation conducted under Sec.  1.505(c) or (d), that a foreign 
supplier of food that you import does not produce food in compliance 
with processes and procedures that provide at least the same level of 
public health protection as those required under section 418 or 419 of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, if either is applicable, and 
the implementing regulations, or produces food that is adulterated under 
section 402 or misbranded under section 403(w) (if applicable) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, you must promptly investigate to 
determine whether your FSVP is adequate and, when appropriate, modify 
your FSVP. You must document any investigations, corrective actions, and 
changes to your FSVP that you undertake in accordance with this 
paragraph.
    (c) This section does not limit your obligations with respect to 
other laws enforced by FDA, such as those relating to product recalls.



Sec.  1.509  How must the importer be identified at entry?

    (a) You must ensure that, for each line entry of food product 
offered for importation into the United States, your name, electronic 
mail address, and unique facility identifier recognized as acceptable by 
FDA, identifying you as the importer of the food, are provided 
electronically when filing entry with U.S. Customs and Border 
Protection.
    (b) Before an article of food is imported or offered for import into 
the United States, the foreign owner or consignee of the food (if there 
is no U.S. owner or consignee) must designate a U.S. agent or 
representative as the importer of the food for the purposes of the 
definition of ``importer'' in Sec.  1.500.



Sec.  1.510  How must I maintain records of my FSVP?

    (a) General requirements for records. (1) You must keep records as 
original records, true copies (such as photocopies, pictures, scanned 
copies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions of the 
original records), or electronic records.
    (2) You must sign and date records concerning your FSVP upon initial 
completion and upon any modification of the FSVP.
    (3) All records must be legible and stored to prevent deterioration 
or loss.
    (b) Record availability. (1) You must make all records required 
under this subpart available promptly to an authorized FDA 
representative, upon request, for inspection and copying. Upon FDA 
request, you must provide within a reasonable time an English 
translation of records maintained in a language other than English.
    (2) Offsite storage of records, including records maintained by 
other entities in accordance with Sec.  1.504, Sec.  1.505, or Sec.  
1.506, is permitted if such records can be retrieved and provided onsite 
within 24 hours of request for official review. Electronic records are 
considered to be onsite if they are accessible from an onsite location.
    (3) If requested in writing by FDA, you must send records to the 
Agency electronically, or through another means that delivers the 
records promptly, rather than making the records available for review at 
your place of business.

[[Page 67]]

    (c) Record retention. (1) Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of 
this section, you must retain records referenced in this subpart until 
at least 2 years after you created or obtained the records.
    (2) You must retain records that relate to your processes and 
procedures, including the results of evaluations and determinations you 
conduct, for at least 2 years after their use is discontinued (e.g., 
because you no longer import a particular food, you no longer use a 
particular foreign supplier, you have reevaluated the risks associated 
with a food and the foreign supplier, or you have changed your supplier 
verification activities for a particular food and foreign supplier).
    (d) Electronic records. Records that are established or maintained 
to satisfy the requirements of this subpart and that meet the definition 
of electronic records in Sec.  11.3(b)(6) of this chapter are exempt 
from the requirements of part 11 of this chapter. Records that satisfy 
the requirements of this subpart, but that also are required under other 
applicable statutory provisions or regulations, remain subject to part 
11.
    (e) Use of existing records. (1) You do not need to duplicate 
existing records you have (e.g., records that you maintain to comply 
with other Federal, State, or local regulations) if they contain all of 
the information required by this subpart. You may supplement any such 
existing records as necessary to include all of the information required 
by this subpart.
    (2) You do not need to maintain the information required by this 
subpart in one set of records. If existing records you have contain some 
of the required information, you may maintain any new information 
required by this subpart either separately or combined with the existing 
records.
    (f) Public disclosure. Records obtained by FDA in accordance with 
this subpart are subject to the disclosure requirements under part 20 of 
this chapter.



Sec.  1.511  What FSVP must I have if I am importing a food subject 
to certain dietary supplement current good manufacturing practice 
regulations?

    (a) Importers subject to certain dietary supplement current good 
manufacturing regulations. If you are required to establish 
specifications under Sec.  111.70(b) or (d) of this chapter with respect 
to a food that is a dietary supplement or dietary supplement component 
you import for further manufacturing, processing, or packaging as a 
dietary supplement, and you are in compliance with the requirements in 
Sec. Sec.  111.73 and 111.75 of this chapter applicable to determining 
whether the specifications you established are met for such food, then 
for that food you must comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.503 
and 1.509, but you are not required to comply with the requirements in 
Sec.  1.502, Sec. Sec.  1.504 through 1.508, or Sec.  1.510. This 
requirement does not limit your obligations with respect to part 111 of 
this chapter or any other laws enforced by FDA.
    (b) Importers whose customer is subject to certain dietary 
supplement current good manufacturing practice regulations. If your 
customer is required to establish specifications under Sec.  111.70(b) 
or (d) of this chapter with respect to a food that is a dietary 
supplement or dietary supplement component you import for further 
manufacturing, processing, or packaging as a dietary supplement, your 
customer is in compliance with the requirements of Sec. Sec.  111.73 and 
111.75 of this chapter applicable to determining whether the 
specifications it established are met for such food, and you annually 
obtain from your customer written assurance that it is in compliance 
with those requirements, then for that food you must comply with the 
requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.503, 1.509, and 1.510, but you are not 
required to comply with the requirements in Sec.  1.502 or Sec. Sec.  
1.504 through 1.508.
    (c) Other importers of dietary supplements--(1) General. If the food 
you import is a dietary supplement and neither paragraph (a) or (b) of 
this section is applicable, you must comply with paragraph (c) of this 
section and the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.503, 1.505(a)(1)(ii) 
through (iv), (a)(2), and (b) through (d),

[[Page 68]]

and 1.508 through 1.510, but you are not required to comply with the 
requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.504, 1.505(a)(1)(i), 1.506, and 1.507. This 
requirement does not limit your obligations with respect to part 111 of 
this chapter or any other laws enforced by FDA.
    (2) Use of approved foreign suppliers. (i) You must establish and 
follow written procedures to ensure that you import foods only from 
foreign suppliers that you have approved based on the evaluation 
conducted under Sec.  1.505 (or, when necessary and appropriate, on a 
temporary basis from unapproved foreign suppliers whose foods you 
subject to adequate verification activities before importing the food). 
You must document your use of these procedures.
    (ii) You may rely on an entity other than the foreign supplier to 
establish the procedures and perform and document the activities 
required under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section provided that you 
review and assess that entity's documentation of the procedures and 
activities, and you document your review and assessment.
    (3) Foreign supplier verification procedures. You must establish and 
follow adequate written procedures for ensuring that appropriate foreign 
supplier verification activities are conducted with respect to the foods 
you import.
    (4) Determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification 
activities--(i) General. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(iii) of 
this section, before importing a dietary supplement from a foreign 
supplier, you must determine and document which verification activity or 
activities listed in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii)(A) through (D) of this 
section, as well as the frequency with which the activity or activities 
must be conducted, are needed to provide adequate assurances that the 
foreign supplier is producing the dietary supplement in accordance with 
processes and procedures that provide the same level of public health 
protection as those required under part 111 of this chapter. This 
determination must be based on the evaluation conducted under Sec.  
1.505.
    (ii) Appropriate verification activities. The following are 
appropriate supplier verification activities:
    (A) Onsite audits as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(A) of this 
section;
    (B) Sampling and testing of a food as specified in paragraph 
(c)(5)(i)(B) of this section;
    (C) Review of the foreign supplier's relevant food safety records as 
specified in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section; and
    (D) Other appropriate supplier verification activities as specified 
in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D) of this section.
    (iii) Reliance upon determination by other entity. You may rely on a 
determination of appropriate foreign supplier verification activities in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section made by an entity 
other than the foreign supplier if you review and assess whether the 
entity's determination regarding appropriate activities (including the 
frequency with which such activities must be conducted) is appropriate 
based on the evaluation conducted in accordance with Sec.  1.505. You 
must document your review and assessment, including documenting that the 
determination of appropriate verification activities was made by a 
qualified individual.
    (5) Performance of foreign supplier verification activities. (i) 
Except as provided in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, for each 
dietary supplement you import under paragraph (c) of this section, you

the verification activities listed in paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through 
(D) of this section before importing the dietary supplement and 
periodically thereafter.
    (A) Onsite auditing. You conduct (and document) or obtain 
documentation of a periodic onsite audit of your foreign supplier.
    (1) An onsite audit of a foreign supplier must be performed by a 
qualified auditor.
    (2) The onsite audit must consider the applicable requirements of 
part 111 of this chapter and include a review of the foreign supplier's 
written food safety plan, if any, and its implementation (or, when 
applicable, an onsite audit may consider relevant laws and regulations 
of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as 
comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the United States).

[[Page 69]]

    (3) If the onsite audit is conducted solely to meet the requirements 
of paragraph (c)(5) of this section by an audit agent of a certification 
body that is accredited in accordance with subpart M of this part, the 
audit is not subject to the requirements in that subpart.
    (4) You must retain documentation of each onsite audit, including 
the audit procedures, the dates the audit was conducted, the conclusions 
of the audit, any corrective actions taken in response to significant 
deficiencies identified during the audit, and documentation that the 
audit was conducted by a qualified auditor.
    (5) The following inspection results may be substituted for an 
onsite audit, provided that the inspection was conducted within 1 year 
of the date by which the onsite audit would have been required to be 
conducted:
    (i) The written results of appropriate inspection of the foreign 
supplier for compliance with the applicable requirements in part 111 of 
this chapter conducted by FDA, representatives of other Federal Agencies 
(such as the USDA), or representatives of State, local, tribal, or 
territorial agencies; or
    (ii) The written results of an inspection by the food safety 
authority of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially 
recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the 
United States, provided that the food that is the subject of the onsite 
audit is within the scope of the official recognition or equivalence 
determination, and the foreign supplier is in, and under the regulatory 
oversight of, such country.
    (B) Sampling and testing of the food. You must retain documentation 
of each sampling and testing of a dietary supplement, including 
identification of the food tested (including lot number, as 
appropriate), the number of samples tested, the test(s) conducted 
(including the analytical method(s) used), the date(s) on which the 
test(s) were conducted and the date of the report of the testing, the 
results of the testing, any corrective actions taken in response to 
detection of hazards, information identifying the laboratory conducting 
the testing, and documentation that the testing was conducted by a 
qualified individual.
    (C) Review of the foreign supplier's food safety records. You must 
retain documentation of each record review, including the date(s) of 
review, the general nature of the records reviewed, the conclusions of 
the review, any corrective actions taken in response to significant

review was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (D) Other appropriate activity. (1) You may conduct (and document) 
or obtain documentation of other supplier verification activities that 
are appropriate based on foreign supplier performance and the risk 
associated with the food.
    (2) You must retain documentation of each activity conducted in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(5)(i)(D)(1) of this section, including a 
description of the activity, the date on which it was conducted, the 
findings or results of the activity, any corrective actions taken in 
response to significant deficiencies identified, and documentation that 
the activity was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (ii) Reliance upon performance of activities by other entities. (A) 
Except as specified in paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, you may 
rely on supplier verification activities conducted in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) by another entity provided that you review and 
assess the results of these activities in accordance with paragraph 
(c)(5)(iii) of this section.
    (B) You may not rely on the foreign supplier or employees of the 
foreign supplier to perform supplier verification activities, except 
with respect to sampling and testing of food in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section.
    (iii) Review of results of verification activities. You must 
promptly review and assess the results of the verification activities 
that you conduct or obtain documentation of under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of 
this section, or that are conducted by other entities in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section. You must document your review and 
assessment of the results of verification activities. If the results

[[Page 70]]

show that the foreign supplier is not producing the dietary supplement 
in accordance with processes and procedures that provide the same level 
of public health protection as those required under part 111 of this 
chapter, you must take appropriate action in accordance with Sec.  
1.508(a). You are not required to retain documentation of supplier 
verification activities conducted by other entities, provided that you 
can obtain the documentation and make it available to FDA in accordance 
with Sec.  1.510(b).
    (iv) Independence of qualified individuals conducting verification 
activities. There must not be any financial conflicts of interest that 
influence the results of the verification activities set forth in 
paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section, and payment must not be related to 
the results of the activity.



Sec.  1.512  What FSVP may I have if I am a very small importer or
I am importing certain food from certain small foreign suppliers?

    (a) Eligibility. This section applies only if:
    (1) You are a very small importer; or
    (2) You are importing certain food from certain small foreign 
suppliers as follows:
    (i) The foreign supplier is a qualified facility as defined by Sec.  
117.3 or Sec.  507.3 of this chapter;
    (ii) You are importing produce from a foreign supplier that is a 
farm that grows produce and is not a covered farm under part 112 of this 
chapter in accordance with Sec.  112.4(a) of this chapter, or in 
accordance with Sec. Sec.  112.4(b) and 112.5 of this chapter; or
    (iii) You are importing shell eggs from a foreign supplier that is 
not subject to the requirements of part 118 of this chapter because it 
has fewer than 3,000 laying hens.
    (b) Applicable requirements--(1) Documentation of eligibility--(i) 
Very small importer status. (A) If you are a very small importer and you 
choose to comply with the requirements in this section, you must 
document that you meet the definition of very small importer in Sec.  
1.500 with respect to human food and/or animal food before initially 
importing food as a very small importer and thereafter on an annual 
basis by December 31 of each calendar year.
    (B) For the purpose of determining whether you satisfy the 
definition of very small importer with respect to human food and/or 
animal food for a given calendar year, the relevant 3-year period of 
sales (and U.S. market value of human or animal food, as appropriate) is 
the period ending 1 year before the calendar year for which you intend 
to import food as a very small importer. The baseline year for 
calculating the adjustment for inflation is 2011. If you conduct any 
food sales in currency other than U.S. dollars, you must use the 
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on December 31 of the year in 
which sales occurred to calculate the value of these sales.
    (ii) Small foreign supplier status. If you are a importing food from 
a small foreign supplier as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this 
section and you choose to comply with the requirements in this section, 
you must obtain written assurance that your foreign supplier meets the 
criteria in paragraph (a)(2)(i), (ii), or (iii) of this section before 
first approving the supplier for an applicable calendar year and 
thereafter on an annual basis by December 31 of each calendar year, for 
the following calendar year.
    (2) Additional requirements. If this section applies and you choose 
to comply with the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, you 
also are required to comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.502, 
1.503, and 1.509, but you are not required to comply with the 
requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.504 through 1.508 or Sec.  1.510.
    (3) Foreign supplier verification activities. (i) If you are a very 
small importer, for each food you import, you must obtain written 
assurance, before importing the food and at least every 2 years 
thereafter, that your foreign supplier is producing the food in 
compliance with processes and procedures that provide at least the same 
level of public health protection as those required under section 418 or 
419 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, if either is 
applicable, and the implementing regulations, and is producing the food 
in compliance with sections 402 and 403(w) (if applicable) of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

[[Page 71]]

    (ii) If your foreign supplier is a qualified facility as defined by 
Sec.  117.3 or Sec.  507.3 of this chapter and you choose to comply with 
the requirements in this section, you must obtain written assurance 
before importing the food and at least every 2 years thereafter that the 
foreign supplier is producing the food in compliance with applicable FDA 
food safety regulations (or, when applicable, the relevant laws and 
regulations of a country whose food safety system FDA has officially 
recognized as comparable or determined to be equivalent to that of the 
United States). The written assurance must include either:
    (A) A brief description of the preventive controls that the supplier 
is implementing to control the applicable hazard in the food; or
    (B) A statement that the supplier is in compliance with State, 
local, county, tribal, or other applicable non-Federal food safety law, 
including relevant laws and regulations of foreign countries.
    (iii) If your foreign supplier is a farm that grows produce and is 
not a covered farm under part 112 of this chapter in accordance with 
Sec.  112.4(a) of this chapter, or in accordance with Sec. Sec.  
112.4(b) and 112.5 of this chapter, and you choose to comply with the 
requirements in this section, you must obtain written assurance before 
importing the produce and at least every 2 years thereafter that the 
farm acknowledges that its food is subject to section 402 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (or, when applicable, that its food is 
subject to relevant laws and regulations of a country whose food safety 
system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or determined to be 
equivalent to that of the United States).
    (iv) If your foreign supplier is a shell egg producer that is not 
subject to the requirements of part 118 of this chapter because it has 
fewer than 3,000 laying hens and you choose to comply with the 
requirements in this section, you must obtain written assurance before 
importing the shell eggs and at least every 2 years thereafter that the 
shell egg producer acknowledges that its food is subject to section 402 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (or, when applicable, that 
its food is subject to relevant laws and regulations of a country whose 
food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or 
determined to be equivalent to that of the United States) .
    (4) Corrective actions. You must promptly take appropriate 
corrective actions if you determine that a foreign supplier of food you 
import does not produce the food consistent with the assurance provided 
in accordance with Sec.  1.512(b)(3)(i) through (iv). The appropriate 
corrective actions will depend on the circumstances but could include 
discontinuing use of the foreign supplier until the cause or causes of 
noncompliance, adulteration, or misbranding have been adequately 
addressed. You must document any corrective actions you take in 
accordance with this paragraph (b)(4). This paragraph (b)(4) does not 
limit your obligations with respect to other laws enforced by FDA, such 
as those relating to product recalls.
    (5) Records--(i) General requirements for records. (A) You must keep 
records as original records, true copies (such as photocopies, pictures, 
scanned copies, microfilm, microfiche, or other accurate reproductions 
of the original records), or electronic records.
    (B) You must sign and date records concerning your FSVP upon initial 
completion and upon any modification of the FSVP.
    (C) All records must be legible and stored to prevent deterioration 
or loss.
    (ii) Availability. (A) You must make all records required under this 
subpart available promptly to an authorized FDA representative, upon

within a reasonable time an English translation of records maintained in 
a language other than English.
    (B) Offsite storage of records, including records retained by other 
entities in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, is permitted 
if such records can be retrieved and provided onsite within 24 hours of 
request for official review. Electronic records are considered to be 
onsite if they are accessible from an onsite location.

[[Page 72]]

    (C) If requested in writing by FDA, you must send records to the 
Agency electronically or through another means that delivers the records 
promptly, rather than making the records available for review at your 
place of business.
    (iii) Record retention. (A) Except as specified in paragraph 
(b)(5)(iii)(B) or (C) of this section, you must retain records required 
under this subpart for a period of at least 2 years after you created or 
obtained the records.
    (B) If you are subject to paragraph (c) of this section, you must 
retain records that relate to your processes and procedures, including 
the results of evaluations of foreign suppliers and procedures to ensure 
the use of approved suppliers, for at least 2 years after their use is 
discontinued (e.g., because you have reevaluated a foreign supplier's 
compliance history or changed your procedures to ensure the use of 
approved suppliers).
    (C) You must retain for at least 3 years records that you rely on 
during the 3-year period preceding the applicable calendar year to 
support your status as a very small importer.
    (iv) Electronic records. Records that are established or maintained 
to satisfy the requirements of this subpart and that meet the definition 
of electronic records in Sec.  11.3(b)(6) of this chapter are exempt 
from the requirements of part 11 of this chapter. Records that satisfy 
the requirements of this part, but that also are required under other 
applicable statutory provisions or regulations, remain subject to part 
11.
    (v) Use of existing records. (A) You do not need to duplicate 
existing records you have (e.g., records that you maintain to comply 
with other Federal, State, or local regulations) if they contain all of 
the information required by this subpart. You may supplement any such 
existing records as necessary to include all of the information required 
by this subpart.
    (B) You do not need to maintain the information required by this 
subpart in one set of records. If existing records you have contain some 
of the required information, you may maintain any new information 
required by this subpart either separately or combined with the existing 
records.
    (vi) Public disclosure. Records obtained by FDA in accordance with 
this subpart are subject to the disclosure requirements under part 20 of 
this chapter.
    (c) Requirements for importers of food from certain small foreign 
suppliers. The following additional requirements apply if you are 
importing food from certain small foreign suppliers as specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section and you are not a very small importer:
    (1) Evaluation of foreign supplier compliance history--(i) Initial 
evaluation. In approving your foreign suppliers, you must evaluate the 
applicable FDA food safety regulations and information relevant to the 
foreign supplier's compliance with those regulations, including whether 
the foreign supplier is the subject of an FDA warning letter, import 
alert, or other FDA compliance action related to food safety, and 
document the evaluation. You may also consider other factors relevant to 
a foreign supplier's performance, including those specified in Sec.  
1.505(a)(1)(iii)(A) and (C).
    (ii) Reevaluation of foreign supplier compliance history. (A) Except 
as specified in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, you must promptly 
reevaluate the concerns associated with the foreign supplier's 
compliance history when you become aware of new information about the 
matters in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and the reevaluation 
must be documented. If you determine that the concerns associated with 
importing a food from a foreign supplier have changed, you must promptly 
determine (and document) whether it is appropriate to continue to import 
the food from the foreign supplier.
    (B) If at the end of any 3-year period you have not reevaluated the 
concerns associated with the foreign supplier's compliance history in 
accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, you must 
reevaluate those concerns and take other appropriate actions, if 
necessary, in accordance with paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A). You must document 
your reevaluation and any subsequent actions you take in accordance with 
paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A).

[[Page 73]]

    (iii) Review of another entity's evaluation or reevaluation of 
foreign supplier compliance history. If an entity other than the foreign 
supplier has, using a qualified individual, performed the evaluation 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section or the reevaluation 
described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii), you may meet the requirements of the 
applicable paragraph by reviewing and assessing the evaluation or 
reevaluation conducted by that entity. You must document your review and 
assessment, including documenting that the evaluation or reevaluation 
was conducted by a qualified individual.
    (2) Approval of foreign supplier. You must approve your foreign 
suppliers on the basis of the evaluation you conducted under paragraph 
(c)(1)(i) of this section or that you review and assess under paragraph 
(c)(1)(iii) of this section, and document your approval.
    (3) Use of approved foreign suppliers. (i) You must establish and 
follow written procedures to ensure that you import foods only from 
foreign suppliers you have approved based on the evaluation conducted 
under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section (or, when necessary and 
appropriate, on a temporary basis from unapproved foreign suppliers 
whose foods you subject to adequate verification activities before 
importing the food). You must document your use of these procedures.
    (ii) You may rely on an entity other than the foreign supplier to 
establish the procedures and perform and document the activities 
required under paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section provided that you 
review and assess that entity's documentation of the procedures and 
activities, and you document your review and assessment.



Sec.  1.513  What FSVP may I have if I am importing certain food 
from a country with an officially recognized or equivalent food 
safety system?

    (a) General. (1) If you meet the conditions and requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section for a food of the type specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section that you are importing, then you are 
not required to comply with the requirements in Sec. Sec.  1.504 through 
1.508. You would still be required to comply with the requirements in 
Sec. Sec.  1.503, 1.509, and 1.510.
    (2) This section applies to food that is not intended for further 
manufacturing/processing, including packaged food products and raw 
agricultural commodities that will not be commercially processed further 
before consumption.
    (b) Conditions and requirements. (1) Before importing a food from 
the foreign supplier and annually thereafter, you must document that the 
foreign supplier is in, and under the regulatory oversight of, a country 
whose food safety system FDA has officially recognized as comparable or 
determined to be equivalent to that of the United States, and that the 
food is within the scope of that official recognition or equivalency 
determination.
    (2) Before importing a food from the foreign supplier, you must 
determine and document whether the foreign supplier of the food is in 
good compliance standing with the food safety authority of the country 
in which the foreign supplier is located. You must continue to monitor 
whether the foreign supplier is in good compliance standing and promptly 
review any information obtained. If the information indicates that food 
safety hazards associated with the food are not being significantly 
minimized or prevented, you must take prompt corrective action. The 
appropriate corrective action will depend on the circumstances but could 
include discontinuing use of the foreign supplier. You must document any 
corrective actions that you undertake in accordance with this paragraph 
(b)(2).



Sec.  1.514  What are some consequences of failing to comply with 
the requirements of this subpart?

    (a) Refusal of admission. An article of food is subject to refusal 
of admission under section 801(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act if it appears that the importer of that food fails to 
comply with this subpart with respect to that food. If there is no U.S. 
owner or consignee of an article of food at the time the food is offered 
for entry into the United States, the article of food may not be 
imported into the United States unless the foreign owner

[[Page 74]]

or consignee has appropriately designated a U.S. agent or representative 
as the importer in accordance with Sec.  1.500.
    (b) Prohibited act. The importation or offering for importation into 
the United States of an article of food without the importer having an 
FSVP that meets the requirements of section 805 of the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, including the requirements of this subpart, is 
prohibited under section 301(zz) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act.



 Subpart M_Accreditation of Third-Party Certification Bodies To Conduct 
             Food Safety Audits and To Issue Certifications

    Source: 80 FR 74650, Nov. 27, 2015, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  1.600  What definitions apply to this subpart?

    (a) The FD&C Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

terms are used in this subpart.
    (c) In addition, for the purposes of this subpart:
    Accreditation means a determination by a recognized accreditation 
body (or, in the case of direct accreditation, by FDA) that a third-
party certification body meets the applicable requirements of this 
subpart.
    Accreditation body means an authority that performs accreditation of 
third-party certification bodies.
    Accredited third-party certification body means a third-party 
certification body that a recognized accreditation body (or, in the case 
of direct accreditation, FDA) has determined meets the applicable 
requirements of this subpart and is accredited to conduct food safety 
audits and to issue food or facility certifications to eligible 
entities. An accredited third-party certification body has the same 
meaning as accredited third-party auditor as defined in section 
808(a)(4) of the FD&C Act.
    Assessment means:
    (i) With respect to an accreditation body, an evaluation by FDA of 
the competency and capacity of the accreditation body under the 
applicable requirements of this subpart for the defined scope of 
recognition. An assessment of the competency and capacity of the 
accreditation body involves evaluating the competency and capacity of 
the operations of the accreditation body that are relevant to decisions 
on recognition and, if recognized, an evaluation of its performance and 
the validity of its accreditation decisions under the applicable 
requirements of this subpart.
    (ii) With respect to a third-party certification body, an evaluation 
by a recognized accreditation body (or, in the case of direct 
accreditation, FDA) of the competency and capacity of a third-party 
certification body under the applicable requirements of this subpart for 
the defined scope of accreditation. An assessment of the competency and 
capacity of the third-party certification body involves evaluating the 
competency and capacity of the operations of the third-party 
certification body that are relevant to decisions on accreditation and, 
if accredited, an evaluation of its performance and the validity of its 
audit results and certification decisions under the applicable 
requirements of this subpart.
    Audit means the systematic and functionally independent examination 
of an eligible entity under this subpart by an accredited third-party 
certification body or by FDA. An audit conducted under this subpart is 
not considered an inspection under section 704 of the FD&C Act.
    Audit agent means an individual who is an employee or other agent of 
an accredited third-party certification body who, although not 
individually accredited, is qualified to conduct food safety audits on 
behalf of an accredited third-party certification body. An audit agent 
includes a contractor of the accredited third-party certification body 
but excludes subcontractors or other agents under outsourcing 
arrangements for conducting food safety audits without direct control by 
the accredited third-party certification body.
    Consultative audit means an audit of an eligible entity:

[[Page 75]]

    (i) To determine whether such entity is in compliance with the 
applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act, FDA regulations, 
and industry standards and practices;
    (ii) The results of which are for internal purposes only; and
    (iii) That is conducted in preparation for a regulatory audit; only 
the results of a regulatory audit may form the basis for issuance of a 
food or facility certification under this subpart.
    Direct accreditation means accreditation of a third-party 
certification body by FDA.
    Eligible entity means a foreign entity in the import supply chain of 
food for consumption in the United States that chooses to be subject to 
a food safety audit under this subpart conducted by an accredited third-
party certification body. Eligible entities include foreign facilities 
required to be registered under subpart H of this part.
    Facility means any structure, or structures of an eligible entity 
under one ownership at one general physical location, or, in the case of 
a mobile facility, traveling to multiple locations, that manufactures/
processes, packs, holds, grows, harvests, or raises animals for food for 
consumption in the United States. Transport vehicles are not facilities 
if they hold food only in the usual course of business as carriers. A 
facility may consist of one or more contiguous structures, and a single 
building may house more than one distinct facility if the facilities are 
under separate ownership. The private residence of an individual is not 
a facility. Non-bottled water drinking water collection and distribution 
establishments and their structures are not facilities. Facilities for 
the purposes of this subpart are not limited to facilities required to 
be registered under subpart H of this part.
    Facility certification means an attestation, issued for purposes of 
section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act by an accredited third-party 
certification body, after conducting a regulatory audit and any other 
activities necessary to establish whether a facility complies with the 
applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.
    Food has the meaning given in section 201(f) of the FD&C Act, except 
that food does not include pesticides (as defined in 7 U.S.C. 136(u)).
    Food certification means an attestation, issued for purposes of 
section 801(q) of the FD&C Act by an accredited third-party 
certification body, after conducting a regulatory audit and any other 
activities necessary to establish whether a food of an eligible entity 
complies with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act 
and FDA regulations.
    Food safety audit means a regulatory audit or a consultative audit 
that is conducted to determine compliance with the applicable food 
safety requirements of the FD&C Act, FDA regulations, and for 
consultative audits, also includes conformance with industry standards 
and practices. An eligible entity must declare that an audit is to be 
conducted as a regulatory audit or consultative audit at the time of 
audit planning and the audit will be conducted on an unannounced basis 
under this subpart.
    Foreign cooperative means an autonomous association of persons, 
identified as members, who are united through a jointly owned enterprise 
to aggregate food from member growers or processors that is intended for 
export to the United States.
    Recognized accreditation body means an accreditation body that FDA 
has determined meets the applicable requirements of this subpart and is 
authorized to accredit third-party certification bodies under this 
subpart.
    Regulatory audit means an audit of an eligible entity:
    (i) To determine whether such entity is in compliance with the 
applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations; 
and
    (ii) The results of which are used in determining eligibility for 
certification under section 801(q) or under section 806 of the FD&C Act.
    Relinquishment means:
    (i) With respect to an accreditation body, a decision to cede 
voluntarily its authority to accredit third-party certification bodies 
as a recognized accreditation body prior to expiration of its 
recognition under this subpart; and

[[Page 76]]

    (ii) With respect to a third-party certification body, a decision to 
cede voluntarily its authority to conduct food safety audits and to 
issue food and facility certifications to eligible entities as an 
accredited third-party certification body prior to expiration of its 
accreditation under this subpart.
    Self-assessment means an evaluation conducted by a recognized 
accreditation body or by an accredited third-party certification body of 
its competency and capacity under the applicable requirements of this 
subpart for the defined scope of recognition or accreditation. For 
recognized accreditation bodies this involves evaluating the competency 
and capacity of the entire operations of the accreditation body and the 
validity of its accreditation decisions under the applicable 
requirements of this subpart. For accredited third-party certification 
bodies this involves evaluating the competency and capacity of the 
entire operations of the third-party certification body and the validity 
of its audit results under the applicable requirements of this subpart.
    Third-party certification body has the same meaning as third-party 
auditor as that term is defined in section 808(a)(3) of the FD&C Act and

    (a) Applicant for recognition. An accreditation body seeking 
recognition must submit an application demonstrating that it meets the 
eligibility requirements in Sec.  1.610.
    (b) Applicant for renewal of recognition. An accreditation body 
seeking renewal of its accreditation must submit a renewal application 
demonstrating that it continues to meet the requirements of this 
subpart.
    (c) Submission. Recognition and renewal applications and any

electronically, in English. An applicant must provide any translation 
and interpretation services needed by FDA during the processing of the 
application, including during onsite assessments of the applicant by 
FDA.
    (d) Signature. Recognition and renewal applications must be signed 
in the manner designated by FDA, by an individual authorized to act on 
behalf of the applicant for purposes of seeking recognition or renewal 
of recognition.



Sec.  1.631  How will FDA review my application for recognition or
renewal of recognition and what happens once FDA decides on my 
application?

    (a) Review of recognition or renewal application. FDA will examine 
an accreditation body's recognition or renewal application for 
completeness and notify the applicant of any deficiencies. FDA will 
review an accreditation body's recognition or renewal application on a 
first in, first out basis according to the date on which the completed 
application was submitted; however, FDA may prioritize the review of 
specific applications to meet the needs of the program.
    (b) Evaluation of recognition or renewal. FDA will evaluate any 
completed recognition or renewal application to determine whether the 
applicant meets the applicable requirements of this subpart. Such 
evaluation may include an onsite assessment of the accreditation body. 
FDA will notify the

[[Page 83]]

applicant, in writing, regarding whether the application has been 
approved or denied. FDA may make such notification electronically. If 
FDA does not reach a final decision on a renewal application before an 
accreditation body's recognition terminates by expiration, FDA may 
extend such recognition for a specified period of time or until the 
Agency reaches a final decision on the renewal application.
    (c) Issuance of recognition. FDA will notify an applicant that its 
recognition or renewal application has been approved through issuance of 
recognition that will list any limitations associated with the 
recognition.
    (d) Issuance of denial of recognition or renewal application. FDA 
will notify an applicant that its recognition or renewal application has 
been denied through issuance of a denial of recognition or denial of a 
renewal application that will state the basis for such denial and 
provide the procedures for requesting reconsideration of the application 
under Sec.  1.691.
    (e) Notice of records custodian after denial of an application for 
renewal of recognition. An applicant whose renewal application was 
denied must notify FDA electronically, in English, within 10 business 
days of the date of issuance of a denial of a renewal application, of 
the name and contact information of the custodian who will maintain the 
records required by Sec.  1.625(a) and make them available to FDA as 
required by Sec.  1.625(b). The contact information for the custodian 
must include, at a minimum, an email address and the physical address 
where the records required by Sec.  1.625(a) will be located.
    (f) Effect of denial of an application for renewal of recognition of 
an accreditation body on accredited third-party certification bodies. 
(1) FDA will issue a notice of the denial of a recognition renewal to 
any third-party certification bodies accredited by the accreditation 
body whose renewal application was denied. The third-party certification 
body's accreditation will remain in effect so long as the third-party 
certification body:
    (i) No later than 60 days after FDA's issuance of the notice of the 
denial of recognition renewal, conducts a self-assessment under Sec.  
1.655 and reports the results of the self-assessment to FDA under Sec.  
1.656(b); and
    (ii) No later than 1 year after issuance of the notice of denial of 
recognition renewal or the original date of the expiration of the 
accreditation, whichever comes first, becomes accredited by another 
recognized accreditation body or by FDA through direct accreditation.
    (2) FDA may withdraw the accreditation of a third-party 
certification body whenever FDA determines there is good cause for 
withdrawal of accreditation under Sec.  1.664(c).
    (g) Effect of denial of an application for renewal of recognition of 
an accreditation body on food or facility certifications issued to 
eligible entities. A food or facility certification issued by a third-
party certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body 
prior to issuance of a denial of the renewal application will remain in 
effect until the certification expires. If FDA has reason to believe 
that a certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the 
FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the 
certification in determining the admissibility of the article of food 
for which the certification was offered or in determining the importer's 
eligibility for participation in the voluntary qualified importer 
program (VQIP).
    (h) Public notice of denial of an application for renewal of 
recognition of an accreditation body. FDA will provide notice on the Web 
site described in Sec.  1.690 of the date of issuance of a denial of a 
renewal application and will describe the basis for the denial.



Sec.  1.632  What is the duration of recognition?

    FDA may grant recognition of an accreditation body for a period not 
to exceed 5 years from the date of recognition.



Sec.  1.633  How will FDA monitor recognized accreditation bodies?

    (a) FDA will evaluate the performance of each recognized 
accreditation body to determine its compliance with the applicable 
requirements of this subpart. Such assessment must occur

[[Page 84]]

by at least 4 years after the date of recognition for a 5-year 
recognition period, or by no later than the mid-term point for a 
recognition period of less than 5 years. FDA may conduct additional 
assessments of a recognized accreditation body at any time.
    (b) An FDA assessment of a recognized accreditation body may include 
onsite assessments of a representative sample of third-party 
certification bodies the recognized accreditation body accredited and 
onsite audits of a representative sample of eligible entities certified 
by such third-party certification bodies under this subpart. These may 
be conducted at any time and, as FDA determines necessary or 
appropriate, may occur without the recognized accreditation body or, in 
the case of an audit of an eligible entity, the accredited third-party 
certification body present.



Sec.  1.634  When will FDA revoke recognition?

    (a) Grounds for revocation of recognition. FDA will revoke the 
recognition of an accreditation body found not to be in compliance with 
the requirements of this subpart, including for any one or more of the 
following:
    (1) Refusal by the accreditation body to allow FDA to access records 
required by Sec.  1.625, or to conduct an assessment or investigation of 
the accreditation body or of a third-party certification body it 
accredited to ensure the accreditation body's continued compliance with 
the requirements of this subpart.
    (2) Failure to take timely and necessary corrective action when:
    (i) The accreditation of a third-party certification body it 
accredited is withdrawn by FDA under Sec.  1.664(a);
    (ii) A significant deficiency is identified through self-assessment 
under Sec.  1.622, monitoring under Sec.  1.621, or self-assessment by 
one or more of its accredited third-party certification bodies under 
Sec.  1.655; or
    (iii) Directed to do so by FDA to ensure compliance with this 
subpart.
    (3) A determination by FDA that the accreditation body has committed 
fraud or has submitted material false statements to the Agency.
    (4) A determination by FDA that there is otherwise good cause for 
revocation, including:
    (i) Demonstrated bias or lack of objectivity when conducting 
activities under this subpart; or
    (ii) Failure to adequately support one or more decisions to grant 
accreditation under this subpart.
    (b) Records request associated with revocation. To assist in 
determining whether revocation is warranted under paragraph (a) of this 
section, FDA may request records of the accreditation body required by 
Sec.  1.625 or the records, required by Sec.  1.658, of one or more of 
the third-party certification bodies it accredited under this subpart.
    (c) Issuance of revocation of recognition. (1) FDA will notify an 
accreditation body that its recognition has been revoked through 
issuance of a revocation that will state the grounds for revocation, the 
procedures for requesting a regulatory hearing under Sec.  1.693 on the 
revocation, and the procedures for requesting reinstatement of 
recognition under Sec.  1.636.
    (2) Within 10 business days of the date of issuance of the 
revocation, the accreditation body must notify FDA electronically, in 
English, of the name of the custodian who will maintain the records and 
make them available to FDA as required by Sec.  1.625. The contact 
information for the custodian must provide, at a minimum, an email 
address and the physical address where the records will be located.
    (d) Effect of revocation of recognition of an accreditation body on 
accredited third-party certification bodies. (1) FDA will issue a notice 
of the revocation of recognition to any accredited third-party 
certification body accredited by the accreditation body whose 
recognition was revoked. The third-party certification body's 
accreditation will remain in effect if the third-party certification 
body:
    (i) No later than 60 days after FDA's issuance of the notice of 
revocation, conducts a self-assessment under Sec.  1.655 and reports the 
results of the self-assessment to FDA under Sec.  1.656(b); and
    (ii) No later than 1 year after issuance of the notice of the 
revocation, or the original date of expiration of the accreditation, 
whichever comes

[[Page 85]]

first, becomes accredited by another recognized accreditation body or by 
FDA through direct accreditation.
    (2) FDA may withdraw the accreditation of a third-party 
certification body whenever FDA determines there is good cause for 
withdrawal of accreditation under Sec.  1.664(c).
    (e) Effect of revocation of recognition of an accreditation body on 
food or facility certifications issued to eligible entities. A food or 
facility certification issued by a third-party certification body 
accredited by a recognized accreditation body prior to issuance of the 
revocation of recognition will remain in effect until the certificate 
terminates by expiration. If FDA has reason to believe that a 
certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C 
Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the 
certification in determining the admissibility of the article of food 
for which the certification was offered or in determining the importer's 
eligibility for participation in VQIP.
    (f) Public notice of revocation of recognition. FDA will provide 
notice on the Web site described in Sec.  1.690 of the issuance of the 
revocation of recognition of an accreditation body and will describe the 
basis for revocation.



Sec.  1.635  What if I want to voluntarily relinquish recognition
or do not want to renew recognition?

    (a) Notice to FDA of intent to relinquish or not to renew 
recognition. A recognized accreditation body must notify FDA 
electronically, in English, at least 60 days before voluntarily 
relinquishing recognition or before allowing recognition to expire 
without seeking renewal. The recognized accreditation body must provide 
the name and contact information of the custodian who will maintain the 
records required under Sec.  1.625(a) after the date of relinquishment 
or the date recognition expires, as applicable, and make them available 
to FDA as required by Sec.  1.625(b). The contact information for the 
custodian must include, at a minimum, an email address and the physical 
address where the records required by Sec.  1.625(a) will be located.
    (b) Notice to accredited third-party certification bodies of intent 
to relinquish or not to renew recognition. No later than 15 business 
days after notifying FDA under paragraph (a) of this section, the 
recognized accreditation body must notify any currently accredited 
third-party certification body that it intends to relinquish recognition 
or to allow its recognition to expire, specifying the date on which 
relinquishment or expiration will occur. The recognized accreditation 
body must establish and maintain records of such notification under 
Sec.  1.625.
    (c)(1) Effect of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of 
recognition on third-party certification bodies. The accreditation of a 
third-party certification body issued prior to the relinquishment or 
expiration of its accreditation body's recognition will remain in 
effect, so long as the third-party certification body:
    (i) No later than 60 days after the date of relinquishment or the 
date of expiration of the recognition, conducts a self-assessment under 
Sec.  1.655 and reports the results of the self-assessment to FDA under 
Sec.  1.656(b); and
    (ii) No later than 1 year after the date of relinquishment or the 
date of expiration of recognition, or the original date of the 
expiration of the accreditation, whichever comes first, becomes 
accredited by another recognized accreditation body or by FDA through 
direct accreditation.
    (2) FDA may withdraw the accreditation of a third-party 
certification body whenever FDA determines there is good cause for 
withdrawal of accreditation under Sec.  1.664(c).
    (d) Effect of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of recognition 
of an accreditation body on food or facility certifications issued to 
eligible entities. A food or facility certification issued by a third-
party certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body 
prior to relinquishment or expiration of its recognition will remain in 
effect until the certification expires. If FDA has reason to believe 
that a certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the 
FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the 
certification in determining the admissibility of the article of food 
for which the certification was

[[Page 86]]

offered or in determining the importer's eligibility for participation 
in VQIP.
    (e) Public notice of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of 
recognition. FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in Sec.  
1.690 of the voluntary relinquishment or expiration of recognition of an 
accreditation body under this subpart.



Sec.  1.636  How do I request reinstatement of recognition?

    (a) Application following revocation. An accreditation body that has 
had its recognition revoked may seek reinstatement by submitting a new 
application for recognition under Sec.  1.630. The accreditation body 
must submit evidence that the grounds for revocation have been resolved, 
including evidence addressing the cause or conditions that were the 
basis for revocation and identifying measures that have been implemented 
to help ensure that such cause(s) or condition(s) are unlikely to recur.
    (b) Application following relinquishment. An accreditation body that 
previously relinquished its recognition under Sec.  1.635 may seek 
recognition by submitting a new application for recognition under Sec.  
1.630.

    Requirements for Third-Party Certification Bodies That Have Been 
                      Accredited Under This Subpart



Sec.  1.650  How must an accredited third-party certification body
ensure its audit agents are competent and objective?

    (a) An accredited third-party certification body that uses audit 
agents to conduct food safety audits must ensure that each such audit 
agent meets the following requirements with respect to the scope of its 
accreditation under this subpart. If the accredited third-party 
certification body is an individual, that individual is also subject to 
the following requirements, as applicable:
    (1) Has relevant knowledge and experience that provides an adequate 
basis for the audit agent to evaluate compliance with applicable food 
safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations and, for 
consultative audits, also includes conformance with applicable industry 
standards and practices;
    (2) Has been determined by the accredited third-party certification 
body, through observations of a representative sample of audits, to be 
competent to conduct food safety audits under this subpart relevant to 
the audits they will be assigned to perform;
    (3) Has completed annual food safety training that is relevant to 
activities conducted under this subpart;
    (4) Is in compliance with the conflict of interest requirements of 
Sec.  1.657 and has no other conflicts of interest with

[[Page 88]]

the eligible entity to be audited that might impair the audit agent's 
objectivity; and
    (5) Agrees to notify its accredited third-party certification body 
immediately upon discovering, during a food safety audit, any condition 
that could cause or contribute to a serious risk to the public health.
    (b) In assigning an audit agent to conduct a food safety audit at a 
particular eligible entity, an accredited third-party certification body 
must determine that the audit agent is qualified to conduct such audit 
under the criteria established in paragraph (a) of this section and 
based on the scope and purpose of the audit and the type of facility, 
its process(es), and food.
    (c) An accredited third-party certification body cannot use an audit 
agent to conduct a regulatory audit at an eligible entity if such audit 
agent conducted a consultative audit or regulatory audit for the same 
eligible entity in the preceding 13 months, except that such limitation 
may be waived if the accredited third-party certification body 
demonstrates to FDA, under Sec.  1.663, there is insufficient access to 
audit agents in the country or region where the eligible entity is 
located. If the accredited third-party certification body is an 
individual, that individual is also subject to such limitations.



Sec.  1.651  How must an accredited third-party certification body
conduct a food safety audit of an eligible entity?

    (a) Audit planning. Before beginning to conduct a food safety audit 
under this subpart, an accredited third-party certification body must:
    (1) Require the eligible entity seeking a food safety audit to:
    (i) Identify the scope and purpose of the food safety audit, 
including the facility, process(es), or food to be audited; whether the 
food safety audit is to be conducted as a consultative or regulatory 
audit subject to the requirements of this subpart, and if a regulatory 
audit, the type(s) of certification(s) sought; and
    (ii) Provide a 30-day operating schedule for such facility that 
includes information relevant to the scope and purpose of the audit; and
    (2) Determine whether the requested audit is within its scope of 
accreditation.
    (b) Authority to audit. In arranging a food safety audit with an 
eligible entity under this subpart, an accredited third-party 
certification body must ensure it has authority, whether contractual or 
otherwise, to:
    (1) Conduct an unannounced audit to determine whether the facility, 
process(es), and food of the eligible entity (within the scope of the 
audit) comply with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C 
Act and FDA regulations and, for consultative audits, also includes 
conformance with applicable industry standards and practices;
    (2) Access any records and any area of the facility, process(es), 
and food of the eligible entity relevant to the scope and purpose of 
such audit;
    (3) When, for a regulatory audit, sampling and analysis is 
conducted, the accredited third-party certification body must use a 
laboratory that is accredited in accordance with:
    (i) ISO/IEC 17025:2005; or
    (ii) Another laboratory accreditation standard that provides at 
least a similar level of assurance in the validity and reliability of 
sampling methodologies, analytical methodologies, and analytical 
results.
    (4) Notify FDA immediately if, at any time during a food safety 
audit, the accredited third-party certification body (or its audit 
agent, where applicable) discovers a condition that could cause or 
contribute to a serious risk to the public health and provide 
information required by Sec.  1.656(c);
    (5) Prepare reports of audits conducted under this subpart as 
follows:
    (i) For consultative audits, prepare reports that contain the 
elements specified in Sec.  1.652(a) and maintain such records, subject 
to FDA access in accordance with section 414 of the FD&C Act; and
    (ii) For regulatory audits, prepare reports that contain the 
elements specified in Sec.  1.652(b) and submit them to FDA and to its 
recognized accreditation body (where applicable) under Sec.  1.656(a); 
and
    (6) Allow FDA and the recognized accreditation body that accredited 
such third-party certification body, if any,

[[Page 89]]

to observe any food safety audit conducted under this subpart for 
purposes of evaluating the accredited third-party certification body's 
performance under Sec. Sec.  1.621 and 1.662 or, where appropriate, the 
recognized accreditation body's performance under Sec. Sec.  1.622 and 
1.633.
    (c) Audit protocols. An accredited third-party certification body 
(or its audit agent, where applicable) must conduct a food safety audit 
in a manner consistent with the identified scope and purpose of the 
audit and within the scope of its accreditation.
    (1) With the exception of records review, which may be scheduled, 
the audit must be conducted without announcement during the 30-day 
timeframe identified under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section and must 
be focused on determining whether the facility, its process(es), and 
food are in compliance with applicable food safety requirements of the 
FD&C Act and FDA regulations, and, for consultative audits, also 
includes conformance with applicable industry standards and practices 
that are within the scope of the audit.
    (2) The audit must include records review prior to the onsite 
examination; an onsite examination of the facility, its process(es), and 
the food that results from such process(es); and where appropriate or 
when required by FDA, environmental or product sampling and analysis. 
When, for a regulatory audit, sampling and analysis is conducted, the 
accredited third-party certification body must use a laboratory that is 
accredited in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The 
audit may include any other activities necessary to determine compliance 
with applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA 
regulations, and, for consultative audits, also includes conformance 
with applicable industry standards and practices.
    (3) The audit must be sufficiently rigorous to allow the accredited 
third-party certification body to determine whether the eligible entity 
is in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the 
FD&C Act and FDA regulations, and for consultative audits, also includes 
conformance with applicable industry standards and practices, at the 
time of the audit; and for a regulatory audit, whether the eligible 
entity, given its food safety system and practices would be likely to 
remain in compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the 
FD&C Act and FDA regulations for the duration of any certification 
issued under this subpart. An accredited third-party certification body 
(or its audit agent, where applicable) that identifies a deficiency 
requiring corrective action may verify the effectiveness of a corrective 
action once implemented by the eligible entity but must not recommend or 
provide input to the eligible entity in identifying, selecting, or 
implementing the corrective action.
    (4) Audit observations and other data and information from the 
examination, including information on corrective actions, must be 
documented and must be used to support the findings contained in the 
audit report required by Sec.  1.652 and maintained as a record under 
Sec.  1.658.



Sec.  1.652  What must an accredited third-party certification body
include in food safety audit reports?

    (a) Consultative audits. An accredited third-party certification 
body must prepare a report of a consultative audit not later than 45 
days after completing such audit and must provide a copy of such report 
to the eligible entity and must maintain such report under Sec.  1.658, 
subject to FDA access in accordance with the requirements of section 414 
of the FD&C Act. A consultative audit report must include:
    (1) The identity of the site or location where the consultative 
audit was conducted, including:
    (i) The name, address and the FDA Establishment Identifier of the 
facility subject to the consultative audit and a unique facility 
identifier, if designated by FDA; and
    (ii) Where applicable, the FDA registration number assigned to the 
facility under subpart H of this part;
    (2) The identity of the eligible entity, if different from the 
facility, including the name, address, the FDA Establishment Identifier 
and unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, and, where 
applicable, registration number under subpart H of this part;

[[Page 90]]

    (3) The name(s) and telephone number(s) of the person(s) responsible 
for compliance with the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C 
Act and FDA regulations
    (4) The dates and scope of the consultative audit;
    (5) The process(es) and food(s) observed during such consultative 
audit; and
    (6) Any deficiencies observed that relate to or may influence a 
determination of compliance with the applicable food safety requirements 
of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations that require corrective action, the 
corrective action plan, and the date on which such corrective actions 
were completed. Such consultative audit report must be maintained as a 
record under Sec.  1.658 and must be made available to FDA in accordance 
with section 414 of the FD&C Act.
    (b) Regulatory audits. An accredited third-party certification body 
must, no later than 45 days after completing a regulatory audit, prepare 
and submit electronically, in English, to FDA and to its recognized 
accreditation body (or, in the case of direct accreditation, only to 
FDA) and must provide to the eligible entity a report of such regulatory 
audit that includes the following information:
    (1) The identity of the site or location where the regulatory audit 
was conducted, including:
    (i) The name, address, and FDA Establishment Identifier of the 
facility subject to the regulatory audit and a unique facility 
identifier, if designated by FDA; and
    (ii) Where applicable, the FDA registration number assigned to the 
facility under subpart H of this part;
    (2) The identity of the eligible entity, if different from the 
facility, including the name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and 
unique facility identifier, if designated by FDA, and, where applicable, 
registration number under subpart H of this part;
    (3) The dates and scope of the regulatory audit;
    (4) The process(es) and food(s) observed during such regulatory 
audit;
    (5) The name(s) and telephone number(s) of the person(s) responsible 
for the facility's compliance with the applicable food safety 
requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations;
    (6) Any deficiencies observed during the regulatory audit that 
present a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to a 
violative product:
    (i) Will cause serious adverse health consequences or death to 
humans and animals; or
    (ii) May cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health 
consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health 
consequences or death to humans or animals is remote;
    (7) The corrective action plan for addressing each deficiency 
identified under paragraph (b)(6) of this section, unless corrective 
action was implemented immediately and verified onsite by the accredited 
third-party certification body (or its audit agent, where applicable);
    (8) Whether any sampling and laboratory analysis (e.g., under a 
microbiological sampling plan) is performed in or used by the facility; 
and
    (9) Whether the eligible entity has made significant changes to the 
facility, its process(es), or food products during the 2 years preceding 
the regulatory audit.
    (c) Submission of regulatory audit report. An accredited third-party 
certification body must submit a completed regulatory audit report as 
required by paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of whether the 
certification body issued a food or facility certification to the 
eligible entity.
    (d) Notice and appeals of adverse regulatory audit results. An 
accredited third-party certification body must notify an eligible entity 
of a denial of certification and must establish and implement written 
procedures for receiving and addressing appeals from eligible entities 
challenging such adverse regulatory audit results and for investigating 
and deciding on appeals in a fair and meaningful manner. The appeals 
procedures must provide similar protections to those offered by FDA 
under Sec. Sec.  1.692 and 1.693, including requirements to:
    (1) Make the appeals procedures publicly available;
    (2) Use competent persons, who may or may not be external to the 
accredited third-party certification body, who

[[Page 91]]

are free from bias or prejudice and have not participated in the 
certification decision or be subordinate to a person who has 
participated in the certification decision, to investigate and decide 
appeals;
    (3) Advise the eligible entity of the final decision on its appeal; 
and
    (4) Maintain records under Sec.  1.658 of the appeal, the final 
decision, and the basis for such decision.



Sec.  1.653  What must an accredited third-party certification body
do when issuing food or facility certifications?

    (a) Basis for issuance of a food or facility certification. (1) 
Prior to issuing a food or facility certification to an eligible entity, 
an accredited third-party certification body (or, where applicable, an 
audit agent on its behalf) must complete a regulatory audit that meets 
the requirements of Sec.  1.651 and any other activities that may be 
necessary to determine compliance with the applicable food safety 
requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations.
    (2) If, as a result of an observation during a regulatory audit, an 
eligible entity must implement a corrective action plan to address a 
deficiency, an accredited third-party certification body may not issue a 
food or facility certification to such entity until after the accredited 
third-party certification body verifies that eligible entity has 
implemented the corrective action plan through methods that reliably 
verify the corrective action was taken and as a result the identified 
deficiency is unlikely to recur, except onsite verification is required 
for corrective actions required to address deficiencies that are the 
subject of a notification under Sec.  1.656(c).
    (3) An accredited third-party certification body must consider each 
observation and the data and other information from a regulatory audit 
and other activities conducted under Sec.  1.651 to determine whether 
the entity was in compliance with the applicable food safety 
requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations at the time of the 
audit and whether the eligible entity, given its food safety system and 
practices, would be likely to remain in compliance for the duration of 
any certification issued under this subpart.
    (4) A single regulatory audit may result in issuance of one or more 
food or facility certifications under this subpart, provided that the 
requirements of issuance are met as to each such certification.
    (5) Where an accredited third-party certification body uses an audit 
agent to conduct a regulatory audit of an eligible entity under this 
subpart, the accredited third-party certification body (and not the 
audit agent) must make the determination whether to issue a food or 
facility certification based on the results of such regulatory audit.
    (b) Issuance of a food or facility certification and submission to 
FDA. (1) Any food or facility certification issued under this subpart 
must be submitted to FDA electronically and in English. The accredited 
third-party certification body may issue a food or facility 
certification under this subpart for a term of up to 12 months.
    (2) A food or facility certification must contain, at a minimum, the 
following elements:
    (i) The name and address of the accredited third-party certification 
body and the scope and date of its accreditation under this subpart;
    (ii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique 
facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the eligible entity to 
which the food or facility certification was issued;
    (iii) The name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier, and unique 
facility identifier, if designated by FDA, of the facility where the 
regulatory audit was conducted, if different than the eligible entity;
    (iv) The scope and date(s) of the regulatory audit and the 
certification number;
    (v) The name of the audit agent(s) (where applicable) conducting the 
regulatory audit; and
    (vi) The scope of the food or facility certification, date of 
issuance, and date of expiration.
    (3) FDA may refuse to accept any certification for purposes of 
section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act, if FDA determines, that such food 
or facility certification is not valid or reliable because, for example:

[[Page 92]]

    (i) The certification is offered in support of the admissibility of 
a food that was not within the scope of the certification;
    (ii) The certification was issued by an accredited third-party 
certification body acting outside the scope of its accreditation under 
this subpart; or
    (iii) The certification was issued without reliable demonstration 
that the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section were met.



Sec.  1.654  When must an accredited third-party certification body
monitor an eligible entity that it has issued a food or facility
certification?

    If an accredited third-party certification body has reason to 
believe that an eligible entity to which it issued a food or facility 
certification may no longer be in compliance with the applicable food 
safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA regulations, the accredited 
third-party certification body must conduct any monitoring (including an 
onsite audit) of such eligible entity necessary to determine whether the 
entity is in compliance with such requirements. The accredited third-
party certification body must immediately notify FDA, under Sec.  
1.656(d), if it withdraws or suspends a food or facility certification 
because it determines that the entity is no longer in compliance with 
the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act and FDA 
regulations. The accredited third-party certification body must maintain 
records of such monitoring under Sec.  1.658.



Sec.  1.655  How must an accredited third-party certification body
monitor its own performance?

    (a) An accredited third-party certification body must annually, upon 
FDA request made for cause, or as required under Sec.  1.631(f)(1)(i), 
Sec.  1.634(d)(1)(i), or Sec.  1.635(c)(1)(i), conduct a self-assessment 
that includes evaluation of compliance with this subpart, including:
    (1) The performance of its officers, employees, or other agents 
involved in auditing and certification activities, including the 
performance of audit agents in examining facilities, process(es), and 
food using the applicable food safety requirements of the FD&C Act and 
FDA regulations;
    (2) The degree of consistency among its officers, employees, or 
other agents involved in auditing and certification activities, 
including evaluating whether its audit agents interpreted audit 
protocols in a consistent manner;
    (3) The compliance of the accredited third-party certification body 
and its officers, employees, and other agents involved in auditing and 
certification activities, with the conflict of interest requirements of 
Sec.  1.657;
    (4) Actions taken in response to the results of any assessments 
conducted by FDA or, where applicable, the recognized accreditation body 
under Sec.  1.621; and
    (5) As requested by FDA, any other aspects of its performance 
relevant to a determination of whether the accredited third-party 
certification body is in compliance with this subpart.
    (b) As a means to assess its performance, the accredited third-party 
certification body may evaluate the compliance of one or more of 
eligible entities to which a food or facility certification was issued 
under this subpart.
    (c) Based on the assessments and evaluations conducted under 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the accredited third-party 
certification body must:
    (1) Identify any deficiencies in complying with the requirements of 
this subpart;
    (2) Quickly implement corrective action(s) that effectively address 
the identified deficiencies; and
    (3) Under Sec.  1.658, establish and maintain records of such 
corrective action(s).
    (d) The accredited third-party certification body must prepare a 
written report of the results of its self-assessment that includes:
    (1) A description of any corrective action(s) taken under paragraph 
(c) of this section;
    (2) A statement disclosing the extent to which the accredited third-
party certification body, and its officers, employees, and other agents 
involved in auditing and certification activities, complied with the 
conflict of interest requirements in Sec.  1.657; and
    (3) A statement attesting to the extent to which the accredited 
third-party certification body complied with

[[Page 93]]

the applicable requirements of this subpart.
    (e) An accredited third-party certification body may use a report, 
supplemented as necessary, on its conformance to ISO/IEC 17021: 2011 or 
ISO/IEC 17065: 2012 in meeting the requirements of this section.



Sec.  1.656  What reports and notifications must an accredited 
third-party certification body submit?

    (a) Reporting results of regulatory audits. An accredited third-
party certification body must submit a regulatory audit report, as

of the accreditation body that granted its accreditation. Such report 
must include an up-to-date list of any audit agents it uses to conduct 
audits under this subpart.
    (c) Notification to FDA of a serious risk to public health. An 
accredited third-party certification body must immediately notify FDA 
electronically, in English, if during a regulatory or consultative 
audit, any of its audit agents or the accredited third-party 
certification body itself discovers a condition that could cause or 
contribute to a serious risk to the public health, providing the 
following information:
    (1) The name, physical address, and unique facility identifier, if 
designated by FDA, of the eligible entity subject to the audit, and, 
where applicable, the registration number under subpart H of this part;
    (2) The name, physical address, and unique facility identifier, if 
designated by FDA, of the facility where the condition was discovered 
(if different from that of the eligible entity) and, where applicable, 
the registration number assigned to the facility under subpart H of this 
part; and
    (3) The condition for which notification is submitted.
    (d) Immediate notification to FDA of withdrawal or suspension of a 
food or facility certification. An accredited third-party certification 
body must notify FDA electronically, in English, immediately upon 
withdrawing or suspending any food or facility certification of an 
eligible entity and the basis for such action.
    (e) Notification to its recognized accreditation body or an eligible 
entity. (1) After notifying FDA under paragraph (c) of this section, an 
accredited third-party certification body must immediately notify the 
eligible entity of such condition and must immediately thereafter notify 
the recognized accreditation body that granted its accreditation, except 
for third-party certification bodies directly accredited by FDA. Where 
feasible and reliable, the accredited third-party certification body may 
contemporaneously notify its recognized accreditation body and/or the 
eligible entity when notifying FDA.
    (2) An accredited third-party certification body must notify its 
recognized accreditation body (or, in the case of direct accreditation, 
FDA) electronically, in English, within 30 days after making any 
significant change that would affect the manner in which it complies 
with the requirements of this subpart and must include with such 
notification the following information:
    (i) A description of the change; and
    (ii) An explanation for the purpose of the change.



Sec.  1.657  How must an accredited third-party certification body
protect against conflicts of interest?

    (a) An accredited third-party certification body must implement a 
written program to protect against conflicts of

[[Page 94]]

interest between the accredited third-party certification body (and its 
officers, employees, and other agents involved in auditing and 
certification activities) and an eligible entity seeking a food safety 
audit or food or facility certification from, or audited or certified 
by, such accredited third-party certification body, including the 
following:
    (1) Ensuring that the accredited third-party certification body and 
its officers, employees, or other agents involved in auditing and 
certification activities do not own, operate, have a financial interest 
in, manage, or otherwise control an eligible entity to be certified, or 
any affiliate, parent, or subsidiary of the entity;
    (2) Ensuring that the accredited third-party certification body and, 
its officers, employees, or other agents involved in auditing and 
certification activities are not owned, managed, or controlled by any 
person that owns or operates an eligible entity to be certified;
    (3) Ensuring that an audit agent of the accredited third-party 
certification body does not own, operate, have a financial interest in, 
manage, or otherwise control an eligible entity or any affiliate, 
parent, or subsidiary of the entity that is subject to a consultative or 
regulatory audit by the audit agent; and
    (4) Prohibiting an accredited third-party certification body's 
officer, employee, or other agent involved in auditing and certification 
activities from accepting any money, gift, gratuity, or other item of

facilitate the efficient conduct of the audit.
    (b) An accredited third-party certification body may accept the 
payment of fees for auditing and certification services and the 
reimbursement of direct costs associated with an audit of an eligible 
entity only after the date on which the report of such audit was 
completed or the date a food or facility certification was issued, 
whichever is later. Such payment is not considered a conflict of 
interest for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (c) The financial interests of the spouses and children younger than 
18 years of age of accredited third-party certification body's officers, 
employees, and other agents involved in auditing and certification 
activities will be considered the financial interests of such officers, 
employees, and other agents involved in auditing and certification 
activities.
    (d) An accredited third-party certification body must maintain on 
its Web site an up-to-date list of the eligible entities to which it has 
issued food or facility certifications under this subpart. For each such 
eligible entity, the Web site also must identify the duration and scope 
of the food or facility certification and date(s) on which the eligible 
entity paid the accredited third-party certification body any fee or 
reimbursement associated with such audit or certification.



Sec.  1.658  What records requirements must a third-party certification
body that has been accredited meet?

    (a) A third-party certification body that has been accredited must 
maintain electronically for 4 years records created during its period of

 Procedures for Accreditation of Third-Party Certification Bodies Under 
                              This Subpart



Sec.  1.660  Where do I apply for accreditation or renewal of
accreditation by a recognized accreditation body and what happens once
the recognized accreditation body decides on my application?

    (a) Submission of accreditation or renewal application to a 
recognized accreditation body. A third-party certification body seeking 
accreditation must submit its request for accreditation or renewal of 
accreditation by a recognized accreditation body identified on the Web 
site described in Sec.  1.690.
    (b) Notice of records custodian after denial of application for 
renewal of accreditation. An applicant whose renewal application was 
denied by a recognized accreditation body must notify FDA 
electronically, in English, within 10 business days of the date of 
issuance of a denial of accreditation or denial of the renewal 
application, of the name and contact information of the custodian who 
will maintain the records required by Sec.  1.658(a) and make them 
available to FDA as required by Sec.  1.658(b) and (c). The contact 
information for the custodian must include, at a minimum, an email 
address and the physical address where the records required by Sec.  
1.658(a) will be located.
    (c) Effect of denial of an application for renewal of accreditation 
on food or facility certifications issued to eligible entities. A food 
or facility certification issued by an accredited third-party 
certification body prior to issuance of the denial of its renewal 
application l will remain in effect until the certification expires. If 
FDA has reason to believe that a certification issued for purposes of 
section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may 
refuse to consider the certification in determining the admissibility of 
the article of food for which the certification was offered or in 
determining the importer's eligibility for participation in VQIP.
    (d) Public notice of denial of an application for renewal of 
accreditation. FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in 
Sec.  1.690 of the date of issuance of a denial of renewal of 
accreditation

[[Page 96]]

of a third-party certification body that had previous been accredited.



Sec.  1.661  What is the duration of accreditation by a recognized
accreditation body?

    A recognized accreditation body may grant accreditation to a third-
party certification body under this subpart for a period not to exceed 4 
years.



Sec.  1.662  How will FDA monitor accredited third-party
certification bodies?

    (a) FDA will periodically evaluate the performance of each 
accredited third-party certification body to determine whether the 
accredited third-party certification body continues to comply with the 
applicable requirements of this subpart and whether there are 
deficiencies in the performance of the accredited third-party 
certification body that, if not corrected, would warrant withdrawal of 
its accreditation under Sec.  1.664. FDA will evaluate each directly 
accredited third-party certification body annually. For a third-party 
certification body accredited by a recognized accreditation body, FDA 
will evaluate an accredited third-party certification body not later 
than 3 years after the date of accreditation for a 4-year term of 
accreditation, or by no later than the mid-term point for accreditation 
granted for less than 4 years. FDA may conduct additional performance 
assessments of an accredited third-party certification body at any time.
    (b) In evaluating the performance of an accredited third-party 
certification body under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA may review 
any one or more of the following:
    (1) Regulatory audit reports and food and facility certifications;
    (2) The accredited third-party certification body's self-assessments 
under Sec.  1.655;
    (3) Reports of assessments by a recognized accreditation body under 
Sec.  1.621;
    (4) Documents and other information relevant to a determination of 
the accredited third-party certification body's compliance with the 
applicable requirements of this subpart; and
    (5) Information obtained by FDA, including during inspections, 
audits, onsite observations, or investigations, of one or more eligible 
entities to which a food or facility certification was issued by such 
accredited third-party certification body.
    (c) FDA may conduct its evaluation of an accredited third-party 
certification body through a site visit to an accredited third-party 
certification body's headquarters (or other location that manages audit 
agents conducting food safety audits under this subpart, if different 
than its headquarters), through onsite observation of an accredited 
third party certification body's performance during a food safety audit 
of an eligible entity, or through document review.



Sec.  1.663  How do I request an FDA waiver or waiver extension for
the 13-month limit for audit agents conducting regulatory audits?

    (a) An accredited third-party certification body may submit a 
request to FDA to waive the requirements of Sec.  1.650(c) preventing an 
audit agent from conducting a regulatory audit of an eligible entity if 
the audit agent (or, in the case that the third-party certification body 
is an individual, the third-party certification body) has conducted a 
food safety audit of such entity during the previous 13 months. The 
accredited third-party certification body seeking a waiver or waiver 
extension must demonstrate there is insufficient access to audit agents 
and any third-party certification bodies that are comprised of an 
individual in the country or region where the eligible entity is 
located.
    (b) Requests for a waiver or waiver extension and all documents 
provided in support of the request must be submitted to FDA 
electronically, in English. The requestor must provide such translation 
and interpretation services as are needed by FDA to process the request.
    (c) The request must be signed by the requestor or by any individual 
authorized to act on behalf of the requestor for purposes of seeking 
such waiver or waiver extension.
    (d) FDA will review requests for waivers and waiver extensions on a 
first in, first out basis according to the

[[Page 97]]

date on which the completed submission is received; however, FDA may 
prioritize the review of specific requests to meet the needs of the 
program. FDA will evaluate any completed waiver request to determine 
whether the criteria for waiver have been met.
    (e) FDA will notify the requestor whether the request for a waiver 
or waiver extension is approved or denied.
    (f) If FDA approves the request, issuance of the waiver will state 
the duration of the waiver and list any limitations associated with it. 
If FDA denies the request, the issuance of a denial of a waiver request 
will state the basis for denial and will provide the address and 
procedures for requesting reconsideration of the request under Sec.  
1.691.
    (g) Unless FDA notifies a requestor that its waiver request has been 
approved, an accredited third-party certification body must not use the 
audit agent to conduct a regulatory audit of such eligible entity until 
the 13-month limit in Sec.  1.650(c) has elapsed.



Sec.  1.664  When would FDA withdraw accreditation?

    (a) Mandatory withdrawal. FDA will withdraw accreditation from a 
third-party certification body:
    (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, if the food 
or facility certified under this subpart is linked to an outbreak of 
foodborne illness or chemical or physical hazard that has a reasonable 
probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death in 
humans or animals;
    (2) Following an evaluation and finding by FDA that the third-party 
certification body no longer complies with the applicable requirements 
of this subpart; or
    (3) Following its refusal to allow FDA to access records under Sec.  
1.658 or to conduct an audit, assessment, or investigation necessary to 
ensure continued compliance with this subpart.
    (b) Exception. FDA may waive mandatory withdrawal under paragraph 
(a)(1) of this section, if FDA:
    (1) Conducts an investigation of the material facts related to the 
outbreak of human or animal illness;
    (2) Reviews the relevant audit records and the actions taken by the 
accredited third-party certification body in support of its decision to 
certify; and
    (3) Determines that the accredited third-party certification body 
satisfied the requirements for issuance of certification under this 
subpart.
    (c) Discretionary withdrawal. FDA may withdraw accreditation, in 
whole or in part, from a third-party certification body when such third-
party certification body is accredited by an accreditation body for 
which recognition is revoked under Sec.  1.634, if FDA determines there 
is good cause for withdrawal, including:
    (1) Demonstrated bias or lack of objectivity when conducting 
activities under this subpart; or
    (2) Performance that calls into question the validity or reliability 
of its food safety audits or certifications.
    (d) Records access. FDA may request records of the accredited third-
party certification body under Sec.  1.658 and, where applicable, may 
request records under Sec.  1.625 of an accreditation body that has been 
recognized under Sec.  1.625, when considering withdrawal under 
paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (c) of this section.
    (e) Notice to the third-party certification body of withdrawal of 
accreditation. (1) FDA will notify a third-party certification body of 
the withdrawal of its accreditation through issuance of a withdrawal 
that will state the grounds for withdrawal, the procedures for 
requesting a regulatory hearing under Sec.  1.693 on the withdrawal, and 
the procedures for requesting reaccreditation under Sec.  1.666.
    (2) Within 10 business days of the date of issuance of the 
withdrawal, the third-party certification body must notify FDA 
electronically, in English, of the name of the custodian who will 
maintain the records required by Sec.  1.658, and provide contact 
information for the custodian, which will at least include an email 
address, and the street address where the records will be located.
    (f) Effect of withdrawal of accreditation on eligible entities. A 
food or facility certification issued by a third-party certification 
body prior to withdrawal

[[Page 98]]

will remain in effect until the certification terminates by expiration. 
If FDA has reason to believe that a certification issued for purposes of 
section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may 
refuse to consider the certification in determining the admissibility of 
the article of food for which the certification was offered or in 
determining the importer's eligibility for participation in VQIP.
    (g) Effect of withdrawal of accreditation on recognized 
accreditation bodies. (1) FDA will notify a recognized accreditation 
body if the accreditation of a third-party certification body it 
accredited is withdrawn by FDA. Such accreditation body's recognition 
will remain in effect if, no later than 60 days after withdrawal, the 
accreditation body conducts a self-assessment under Sec.  1.622 and 
reports the results of the self-assessment to FDA as required by Sec.  
1.623(b).
    (2) FDA may revoke the recognition of an accreditation body whenever 
FDA determines there is good cause for revocation of recognition under 
Sec.  1.634.
    (h) Public notice of withdrawal accreditation. FDA will provide 
notice on the Web site described in Sec.  1.690 of its withdrawal of 
accreditation of a third-party certification body and provide a 
description of the basis for withdrawal.



Sec.  1.665  What if I want to voluntarily relinquish accreditation
or do not want to renew accreditation?

    (a) Notice to FDA of intent to relinquish or not to renew 
accreditation. A third-party certification body must notify FDA 
electronically, in English, at least 60 days before voluntarily 
relinquishing accreditation or before allowing accreditation to expire 
without seeking renewal. The certification body must provide the name 
and contact information of the custodian who will maintain the records 
required under Sec.  1.658(a) after the date of relinquishment or the 
date accreditation expires, as applicable, and make them available to 
FDA as required by Sec.  1.658(b) and (c). The contact information for 
the custodian must include, at a minimum, an email address and the 
physical address where the records required by Sec.  1.658(a) will be 
located.
    (b) Notice to recognized accreditation body and eligible entities of 
intent to relinquish or not to renew accreditation. No later than 15 
business days after notifying FDA under paragraph (a) of this section, 
the certification body must notify its recognized accreditation body and 
any eligible entity with current certifications that it intends to 
relinquish accreditation or to allow its accreditation to expire, 
specifying the date on which relinquishment or expiration will occur. 
The recognized accreditation body must establish and maintain records of 
such notification under Sec.  1.625(a).
    (c) Effect of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of 
accreditation on food or facility certifications issued to eligible 
entities. A food or facility certification issued by a third-party 
certification body prior to relinquishment or expiration of its 
accreditation will remain in effect until the certification expires. If 
FDA has reason to believe that a certification issued for purposes of 
section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may 
refuse to consider the certification in determining the admissibility of 
the article of food for which the certification was offered or in 
determining the importer's eligibility for participation in VQIP.
    (d) Public notice of voluntary relinquishment or expiration of 
accreditation. FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in 
Sec.  1.690 of the voluntary relinquishment or expiration of 
accreditation of a certification body under this subpart.



Sec.  1.666  How do I request reaccreditation?

    (a) Application following withdrawal. FDA will reinstate the 
accreditation of a third-party certification body for which it has 
withdrawn accreditation:
    (1) If, in the case of direct accreditation, FDA determines, based 
on evidence presented by the third-party certification body, that the 
third-party certification body satisfies the applicable requirements of 
this subpart and adequate grounds for withdrawal no longer exist; or

[[Page 99]]

    (2) In the case of a third-party certification body accredited by an 
accreditation body for which recognition has been revoked under Sec.  
1.634:
    (i) If the third-party certification body becomes accredited by 
another recognized accreditation body or by FDA through direct 
accreditation no later than 1 year after withdrawal of accreditation, or 
the original date of the expiration of accreditation, whichever comes 
first; or
    (ii) Under such conditions as FDA may impose in withdrawing 
accreditation.
    (b) Application following voluntary relinquishment. A third-party 
certification body that previously relinquished its accreditation under 
Sec.  1.665 may seek accreditation by submitting a new application for 
accreditation under Sec.  1.660 or, where applicable, Sec.  1.670.

     Additional Procedures for Direct Accreditation of Third-Party 
                 Certification Bodies Under This Subpart



Sec.  1.670  How do I apply to FDA for direct accreditation or
renewal of direct accreditation?

    (a) Eligibility. (1) FDA will accept applications from third-party 
certification bodies for direct accreditation or renewal of direct 
accreditation only if FDA determines that it has not identified and 
recognized an accreditation body to meet the requirements of section 808 
of the FD&C Act within 2 years after establishing the accredited third-
party audits and certification program. Such FDA determination may 
apply, as appropriate, to specific types of third-party certification 
bodies, types of expertise, or geographic location; or through 
identification by FDA of any requirements of section 808 of the FD&C Act 
not otherwise met by previously recognized accreditation bodies. FDA 
will only accept applications for direct accreditation and renewal 
applications that are within the scope of the determination.
    (2) FDA may revoke or modify a determination under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section if FDA subsequently identifies and recognizes an 
accreditation body that affects such determination.
    (3) FDA will provide notice on the Web site described in Sec.  1.690 
of a determination under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and of a 
revocation or modification of the determination under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.
    (b) Application for direct accreditation or renewal of direct 
accreditation. (1) A third-party certification body seeking direct 
accreditation or renewal of direct accreditation must submit an 
application to FDA, demonstrating that it is within the scope of the 
determination issued under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, and it 
meets the eligibility requirements of Sec.  1.640.
    (2) Applications and all documents provided as part of the 
application process must be submitted electronically, in English. An 
applicant must provide such translation and interpretation services as 
are needed by FDA to process the application, including during an onsite 
audit of the applicant.
    (3) The application must be signed in the manner designated by FDA 
by an individual authorized to act on behalf of the applicant for 
purposes of seeking or renewing direct accreditation.



Sec.  1.671  How will FDA review my application for direct accreditation
or renewal of direct accreditation and what happens once FDA decides on 
my application?

    (a) Review of a direct accreditation or renewal application. FDA 
will examine a third-party certification body's direct accreditation or 
renewal application for completeness and notify the applicant of any 
deficiencies. FDA will review applications for direct accreditation and 
for renewal of direct accreditation on a first in, first out basis 
according to the date the completed submission is received; however, FDA 
may prioritize the review of specific applications to meet the needs of 
the program.
    (b) Evaluation of a direct accreditation or renewal application. FDA 
will evaluate any completed application to determine whether the 
applicant meets the requirements for direct accreditation under this 
subpart. If FDA does not reach a final decision on a renewal application 
before the expiration of the direct accreditation, FDA may extend

[[Page 100]]

the duration of such direct accreditation for a specified period of time 
or until the Agency reaches a final decision on the renewal application.
    (c) Notice of approval or denial. FDA will notify the applicant that 
its direct accreditation or renewal application has been approved 
through issuance of or denied.
    (d) Issuance of direct accreditation. If an application has been 
approved, the issuance of the direct accreditation that will list any 
limitations associated with the accreditation.
    (e) Issuance of denial of direct accreditation. If FDA issues a 
denial of direct accreditation or denial of a renewal application, the 
issuance of the denial of direct accreditation will state the basis for 
such denial and provide the procedures for requesting reconsideration of 
the application under Sec.  1.691.
    (f) Notice of records custodian after denial of application for 
renewal of direct accreditation. An applicant whose renewal application 
was denied must notify FDA electronically, in English, within 10 
business days of the date of issuance of a denial of a renewal 
application, of the name and contact information of the custodian who 
will maintain the records required by Sec.  1.658(a) and make them 
available to FDA as required by Sec.  1.658(b) and (c). The contact 
information for the custodian must include, at a minimum, an email 
address and the physical address where the records required by Sec.  
1.658(b) will be located.
    (g) Effect of denial of renewal of direct accreditation on food or 
facility certifications issued to eligible entities. A food or facility 
certification issued by an accredited third-party certification body 
prior to issuance of the denial of its renewal application will remain 
in effect until the certification expires. If FDA has reason to believe 
that a certification issued for purposes of section 801(q) or 806 of the 
FD&C Act is not valid or reliable, FDA may refuse to consider the 
certification in determining the admissibility of the article of food 
for which the certification was offered or in determining the importer's 
eligibility for participation in VQIP.
    (h) Public notice of denial of renewal of direct accreditation. FDA 
will provide notice on the Web site described in Sec.  1.690 of the 
issuance of a denial of renewal application for direct accreditation 
under this subpart.



Sec.  1.672  What is the duration of direct accreditation?

    FDA will grant direct accreditation of a third-party certification 
body for a period not to exceed 4 years.

          Requirements for Eligible Entities Under This Subpart



Sec.  1.680  How and when will FDA monitor eligible entities?

necessary or appropriate, the unannounced audit may be conducted with or 
without the accredited third-party certification body or the recognized 
accreditation body (where applicable) present. An FDA audit conducted 
under this section will be conducted on an unannounced basis and may be 
preceded by a request for a 30-day operating schedule.



Sec.  1.681  How frequently must eligible entities be recertified?

    An eligible entity seeking recertification of a food or facility 
certification under this subpart must apply for recertification prior to 
the expiration of its certification. For certifications used in meeting 
the requirements of section 801(q) or 806 of the FD&C Act, FDA may 
require an eligible entity to apply for recertification at any time FDA 
determines appropriate under such section.

through the issuance of a denial of the application or waiver request 
under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section upon reconsideration.



Sec.  1.692  How do I request internal agency review of a denial of an
application or waiver request upon reconsideration?

    (a) No later than 10 business days after the date of issuance of a 
denial of an application or waiver request upon reconsideration under 
Sec.  1.691, the requestor may seek internal agency review of such

which will include any supporting information submitted under Sec.  
1.691(c).
    (d) After completing the review and evaluation of the administrative 
file, FDA will notify the requestor of its decision to overturn the 
denial and grant the application or waiver request through issuance of 
an application or waiver request upon reconsideration or to affirm the 
denial of the application or waiver request upon reconsideration through 
issuance of a denial of an application or waiver request upon 
reconsideration.
    (e) Issuance by FDA of a denial of an application or waiver request 
upon reconsideration constitutes final agency action under 5 U.S.C. 702.

[[Page 102]]



Sec.  1.693  How do I request a regulatory hearing on a revocation of
recognition or withdrawal of accreditation?

    (a) Request for hearing on revocation. No later than 10 business 
days after the date of issuance of a revocation of recognition of an 
accreditation body under Sec.  1.634, an individual authorized to act on 
the accreditation body's behalf may submit a request for a regulatory 
hearing on the revocation under part 16 of this chapter. The issuance of 
revocation issued under Sec.  1.634 will contain all of the elements 
required by Sec.  16.22 of this chapter and will thereby constitute the 
notice of an opportunity for hearing under part 16 of this chapter.
    (b) Request for hearing on withdrawal. No later than 10 business 
days after the date of issuance of a withdrawal of accreditation of a 
third-party certification body under Sec.  1.664, an individual 
authorized to act on the third-party certification body's behalf may 
submit a request for a regulatory hearing on the withdrawal under part 
16 of this chapter. The issuance of withdrawal under Sec.  1.664 will 
contain all of the elements required by Sec.  16.22 of this chapter and 
will thereby constitute the notice of opportunity of hearing under part 
16 of this chapter.
    (c) Submission of request for regulatory hearing. The request for a 
regulatory hearing under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section must be 
submitted with a written appeal that responds to the basis for the FDA 
decision, as described in the issuance of revocation or withdrawal, as 
appropriate, and includes any supporting information upon which the 
requestor is relying. The request, appeal, and supporting information 
must be submitted in English to the address specified in the notice and 
must comply with the procedures it describes.
    (d) Effect of submission of request on FDA decision. The submission 
of a request for a regulatory hearing under paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section will not operate to delay or stay the effect of a decision by 
FDA to revoke recognition of an accreditation body or to withdraw 
accreditation of a third-party certification body unless FDA determines 
that a delay or a stay is in the public interest.
    (e) Presiding officer. The presiding officer for a regulatory 
hearing for a revocation or withdrawal under this subpart will be 
designated after a request for a regulatory hearing is submitted to FDA.
    (f) Denial of a request for regulatory hearing. The presiding 
officer may deny a request for regulatory hearing for a revocation or 
withdrawal under Sec.  16.26(a) of this chapter when no genuine or 
substantial issue of fact has been raised.
    (g) Conduct of regulatory hearing. (1) If the presiding officer 
grants a request for a regulatory hearing for a revocation or 
withdrawal, the hearing will be held within 10 business days after the 
date the request was filed or, if applicable, within a timeframe agreed 
upon in writing by requestor, the presiding officer, and FDA.
    (2) The presiding officer must conduct the regulatory hearing for 
revocation or withdrawal under part 16 of this chapter, except that, 
under Sec.  16.5(b) of this chapter, such procedures apply only to the 
extent that the procedures are supplementary and do not conflict with 
the procedures specified for regulatory hearings under this subpart. 
Accordingly, the following requirements of part 16 are inapplicable to 
regulatory hearings under this subpart: Sec.  16.22 (Initiation of a 
regulatory hearing); Sec.  16.24(e) (timing) and (f) (contents of 
notice); Sec.  16.40 (Commissioner); Sec.  16.60(a) (public process); 
Sec.  16.95(b) (administrative decision and record for decision); and 
Sec.  16.119 (Reconsideration and stay of action).
    (3) A decision by the presiding officer to affirm the revocation of 
recognition or the withdrawal of accreditation is considered a final 
agency action under 5 U.S.C. 702.



Sec.  1.694  Are electronic records created under this subpart subject
to the electronic records requirements of part 11 of this chapter?

    Records that are established or maintained to satisfy the

Subpart Q_Administrative Detention of Drugs Intended for Human or Animal 
                                   Use



Sec.  1.980  Administrative detention of drugs.

    (a) General. This section sets forth the procedures for detention of 
drugs believed to be adulterated or misbranded. Administrative detention 
is intended to protect the public by preventing distribution or use of 
drugs encountered during inspections that may be adulterated or 
misbranded, until the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has had time to 
consider what action it should take concerning the drugs, and to 
initiate legal action, if appropriate. Drugs that FDA orders detained 
may not be used, moved, altered, or tampered with in any manner by any 
person during the detention period, except as authorized under paragraph 
(h) of this section, until FDA terminates the detention order under 
paragraph (j) of this section, or the detention period expires, 
whichever occurs first.
    (b) Criteria for ordering detention. Administrative detention of 
drugs may be ordered in accordance with this section when an authorized 
FDA representative, during an inspection under section 704 of the 
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, has reason to believe that a drug, 
as defined in section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act, is adulterated or misbranded.
    (c) Detention period. The detention is to be for a reasonable period 
that may not exceed 20 calendar days after the detention order is 
issued, unless the FDA District Director in whose district the drugs are 
located determines that a greater period is required to seize the drugs, 
to institute injunction proceedings, or to evaluate the need for legal 
action, in which case the District Director may authorize detention for 
10 additional calendar days. The additional 10-calendar-day detention 
period may be ordered at the time the detention order is issued or at 
any time thereafter. The entire detention period may not exceed 30 
calendar days, except when the detention period is extended under 
paragraph (g)(6) of this section. An authorized FDA representative may, 
in accordance with paragraph (j) of this section, terminate a detention 
before the expiration of the detention period.
    (d) Issuance of detention order. (1) The detention order must be 
issued in writing, in the form of a detention notice, signed by the 
authorized FDA representative who has reason to believe that the drugs 
are adulterated or misbranded, and issued to the owner, operator, or 
agent in charge of the place where the drugs are located. If the owner 
or the user of the drugs is different from the owner, operator, or agent 
in charge of the place where the drugs are detained, a copy of the 
detention order must be provided to the owner or user of the drugs if 
the owner's or user's identity can be readily determined.
    (2) If detention of drugs in a vehicle or other carrier is ordered, 
a copy of the detention order must be provided to the shipper of record 
and the owner of the vehicle or other carrier, if their identities can 
be readily determined.
    (3) The detention order must include the following information:
    (i) A statement that the drugs identified in the order are detained 
for the period shown;
    (ii) A brief, general statement of the reasons for the detention;
    (iii) The location of the drugs;
    (iv) A statement that these drugs are not to be used, moved, 
altered, or tampered with in any manner during that period, except as 
permitted under paragraph (h) of this section, without the written 
permission of an authorized FDA representative;
    (v) Identification of the detained drugs;

[[Page 104]]

    (vi) The detention order number;
    (vii) The date and hour of the detention order;
    (viii) The period of the detention;
    (ix) The text of section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act and paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section;
    (x) A statement that any informal hearing on an appeal of a 
detention order must be conducted as a regulatory hearing under part 16 
of this chapter, with certain exceptions described in paragraph (g)(3) 
of this section; and
    (xi) The location and telephone number of the FDA district office 
and the name of the FDA District Director.
    (e) Approval of detention order. A detention order, before issuance, 
must be approved by the FDA District Director in whose district the 
drugs are located. If prior written approval is not feasible, prior oral 
approval must be obtained and confirmed by written memorandum within FDA 
as soon as possible.
    (f) Labeling or marking a detained drug. An FDA representative 
issuing a detention order under paragraph (d) of this section must label 
or mark the drugs with official FDA tags that include the following 
information:
    (1) A statement that the drugs are detained by the U.S. Government 
in accordance with section 304(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 334(g)).
    (2) A statement that the drugs must not be used, moved, altered, or 
tampered with in any manner for the period shown, without the written 
permission of an authorized FDA representative, except as authorized in 
paragraph (h) of this section.
    (3) A statement that the violation of a detention order or the 
removal or alteration of the tag is punishable by fine or imprisonment 
or both (section 303 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 
U.S.C. 333)).
    (4) The detention order number, the date and hour of the detention 
order, the detention period, and the name of the FDA representative who 
issued the detention order.
    (g) Appeal of a detention order. (1) A person who would be entitled 
to claim the drugs, if seized, may appeal a detention order. Any appeal 
must be submitted in writing to the FDA District Director in whose 
district the drugs are located within 5 working days of receipt of a 
detention order. If the appeal includes a request for an informal 
hearing, as defined in section 201(x) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321(x)), the appellant must request either that 
a hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed or 
that the hearing be held at a later date, which must not be later than 
20 calendar days after receipt of a detention order.
    (2) The appellant of a detention order must state the ownership or 
proprietary interest the appellant has in the detained drugs. If the 
detained drugs are located at a place other than an establishment owned 
or operated by the appellant, the appellant must include documents 
showing that the appellant would have legitimate authority to claim the 
drugs if seized.
    (3) Any informal hearing on an appeal of a detention order must be 
conducted as a regulatory hearing under regulation in accordance with 
part 16 of this chapter, except that:
    (i) The detention order under paragraph (d) of this section, rather 
than the notice under Sec.  16.22(a) of this chapter, provides notice of 
opportunity for a hearing under this section and is part of the 
administrative record of the regulatory hearing under Sec.  16.80(a) of 
this chapter;
    (ii) A request for a hearing under this section should be addressed 
to the FDA District Director;
    (iii) The last sentence of Sec.  16.24(e) of this chapter, stating 
that a hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 
working days after receipt of the request for a hearing, does not apply 
to a hearing under this section;
    (iv) Paragraph (g)(4) of this section, rather than Sec.  16.42(a) of 
this chapter, describes the FDA employees, i.e., regional food and drug 
directors, who preside at hearings under this section.
    (4) The presiding officer of a regulatory hearing on an appeal of a 
detention order, who also must decide the appeal, must be a regional 
food and drug director (i.e., a director of an FDA regional office 
listed in part 5, subpart

[[Page 105]]

M of this chapter) who is permitted by Sec.  16.42(a) of this chapter to 
preside over the hearing.
    (5) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that 
the hearing be held within 5 working days after the appeal is filed, the 
presiding officer must, within 5 working days, hold the hearing and 
render a decision affirming or revoking the detention.
    (6) If the appellant requests a regulatory hearing and requests that 
the hearing be held at a date later than within 5 working days after the 
appeal is filed, but not later than 20 calendar days after receipt of a 
detention order, the presiding officer must hold the hearing at a date 
agreed upon by FDA and the appellant. The presiding officer must decide 
whether to affirm or revoke the detention within 5 working days after 
the conclusion of the hearing. The detention period extends to the date 
of the decision even if the 5-working-day period for making the decision 
extends beyond the otherwise applicable 20-calendar-day or 30-calendar-
day detention period.
    (7) If the appellant appeals the detention order but does not 
request a regulatory hearing, the presiding officer must render a 
decision on the appeal, affirming or revoking the detention within 5 
working days after the filing of the appeal.
    (8) If the presiding officer affirms a detention order, the drugs 
continue to be detained until FDA terminates the detention under 
paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, whichever 
occurs first.
    (9) If the presiding officer revokes a detention order, FDA must 
terminate the detention under paragraph (j) of this section.
    (h) Movement of detained drugs. (1) Except as provided in this 
paragraph, no person may move detained drugs within or from the place 
where they have been ordered detained until FDA terminates the detention 
under paragraph (j) of this section or the detention period expires, 
whichever occurs first.
    (2) If detained drugs are not in final form for shipment, the 
manufacturer may move them within the establishment where they are 
detained to complete the work needed to put them in final form. As soon 
as the drugs are moved for this purpose, the individual responsible for 
their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the 
detention order, or another responsible district office official, of the 
movement of the drugs. As soon as the drugs are put in final form, they 
must be segregated from other drugs, and the individual responsible for 
their movement must orally notify the FDA representative who issued the 
detention order, or another responsible district office official, of 
their new location. The drugs put in final form must not be moved 
further without FDA approval.
    (3) The FDA representative who issued the detention order, or 
another responsible district office official, may approve, in writing, 
the movement of detained drugs for any of the following purposes:
    (i) To prevent interference with an establishment's operations or 
harm to the drugs;
    (ii) To destroy the drugs;
    (iii) To bring the drugs into compliance;
    (iv) For any other purpose that the FDA representative who issued 
the detention order, or other responsible district office official, 
believes is appropriate in the case.
    (4) If an FDA representative approves the movement of detained drugs 
under paragraph (h)(3) of this section, the detained drugs must remain 
segregated from other drugs and the person responsible for their 
movement must immediately orally notify the official who approved the 
movement of the drugs, or another responsible FDA district office 
official, of the new location of the detained drugs.
    (5) Unless otherwise permitted by the FDA representative who is 
notified of, or who approves, the movement of drugs under this 
paragraph, the required tags must accompany the drugs during and after 
movement and must remain with the drugs until FDA terminates the 
detention or the detention period expires, whichever occurs first.
    (i) Actions involving adulterated or misbranded drugs. If FDA 
determines that the detained drugs, including any that have been put in 
final form, are adulterated or misbranded, or both, it may initiate 
legal action against the drugs

[[Page 106]]

or the responsible individuals, or both, or request that the drugs be 
destroyed or otherwise brought into compliance with the Federal Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act under FDA's supervision.
    (j) Detention termination. If FDA decides to terminate a detention 
or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, an FDA 
representative authorized to terminate a detention will issue a 
detention termination notice releasing the drugs to any person who 
received the original detention order or that person's representative 
and will remove, or authorize in writing the removal of, the required 
labels or tags.
    (k) Recordkeeping requirements. (1) After issuance of a detention 
order under paragraph (d) of this section, the owner, operator, or agent 
in charge of any factory, warehouse, other establishment, or consulting 
laboratory where detained drugs are manufactured, processed, packed, or 
held, must have, or establish, and maintain adequate records relating to 
how the detained drugs may have become adulterated or misbranded, 
records on any distribution of the drugs before and after the detention 
period, records on the correlation of any in-process detained drugs that 
are put in final form under paragraph (h) of this section to the 
completed drugs, records of any changes in, or processing of, the drugs 
permitted under the detention order, and records of any other movement 
under paragraph (h) of this section. Records required under this 
paragraph must be provided to FDA on request for review and copying. Any 
FDA request for access to records required under this paragraph must be 
made at a reasonable time, must state the reason or purpose for the 
request, and must identify to the fullest extent practicable the 
information or type of information sought in the records to which access 
is requested.
    (2) Records required under this paragraph must be maintained for a 
maximum period of 2 years after the issuance of the detention order or 
for such other shorter period as FDA directs. When FDA terminates the 
detention or when the detention period expires, whichever occurs first, 
FDA will advise all persons required under this paragraph to keep 
records concerning that detention whether further recordkeeping is 
required for the remainder of the 2-year, or shorter, period. FDA 
ordinarily will not require further recordkeeping if the Agency 
determines that the drugs are not adulterated or misbranded or that 
recordkeeping is not necessary to protect the public health, unless the 
records are required under other regulations in this chapter (e.g., the 
good manufacturing practice regulation in part 211 of this chapter).

                      Subpart A_General Provisions



Sec.  2.5  Imminent hazard to the public health.

    (a) Within the meaning of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
an imminent hazard to the public health

[[Page 107]]

is considered to exist when the evidence is sufficient to show that a 
product or practice, posing a significant threat of danger to health, 
creates a public health situation (1) that should be corrected 
immediately to prevent injury and (2) that should not be permitted to 
continue while a hearing or other formal proceeding is being held. The 
imminent hazard may be declared at any point in the chain of events 
which may ultimately result in harm to the public health. The occurrence 
of the final anticipated injury is not essential to establish that an 
imminent hazard of such occurrence exists.
    (b) In exercising his judgment on whether an imminent hazard exists, 
the Commissioner will consider the number of injuries anticipated and 
the nature, severity, and duration of the anticipated injury.



Sec.  2.10  Examination and investigation samples.

    (a)(1) When any officer or employee of the Department collects a 
sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, the 
sample shall be designated as an official sample if records or other 
evidence is obtained by him or any other officer or employee of the 
Department indicating that the shipment or other lot of the article from 
which such sample was collected was introduced or delivered for 
introduction into interstate commerce, or was in or was received in 
interstate commerce, or was manufactured within a Territory. Only 
samples so designated by an officer or employee of the Department shall 
be considered to be official samples.
    (2) For the purpose of determining whether or not a sample is 
collected for analysis, the term analysis includes examinations and 
tests.
    (3) The owner of a food, drug, or cosmetic of which an official 
sample is collected is the person who owns the shipment or other lot of 
the article from which the sample is collected.
    (b) When an officer or employee of the Department collects an 
official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic for analysis under the act, 
he shall collect at least twice the quantity estimated by him to be 
sufficient for analysis, unless:
    (1) The amount of the article available and reasonably accessible 
for sampling is less than twice the quantity so estimated, in which case 
he shall collect as much as is available and reasonably accessible.
    (2) The cost of twice the quantity so estimated exceeds $150.
    (3) The sample cannot by diligent use of practicable preservation 
techniques available to the Food and Drug Administration be kept in a 
state in which it could be readily and meaningfully analyzed in the same 
manner and for the same purposes as the Food and Drug Administration's 
analysis.
    (4) The sample is collected from a shipment or other lot which is 
being imported or offered for import into the United States.
    (5) The sample is collected from a person named on the label of the 
article or his agent, and such person is also the owner of the article.
    (6) The sample is collected from the owner of the article, or his 
agent, and such article bears no label or, if it bears a label, no 
person is named thereon.

In addition to the quantity of sample set forth in this paragraph, the 
officer or employee shall, if practicable, collect such further amount 
as he estimates will be sufficient for use as trial exhibits.
    (c) After the Food and Drug Administration has completed such 
analysis of an official sample of a food, drug, or cosmetic as it 
determines, in the course of analysis and interpretation of analytical 
results, to be adequate to establish the respects, if any, in which the 
article is adulterated or misbranded within the meaning of the act, or 
otherwise subject to the prohibitions of the act, and has reserved an 
amount of the article it estimates to be adequate for use as exhibits in 
the trial of any case that may arise under the act based on the sample, 
a part of the sample, if any remains available, shall be provided for 
analysis, upon written request, by any person named on the label of the 
article, or the owner thereof, or the attorney or agent of such person 
or owner, except when:

[[Page 108]]

    (1) After collection, the sample or remaining part thereof has 
become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis, or
    (2) The request is not made within a reasonable time before the 
trial of any case under the act, based on the sample to which such 
person or owner is a party. The person, owner, attorney, or agent who 
requests the part of sample shall specify the amount desired. A request 
from an owner shall be accompanied by a showing of ownership, and a 
request from an attorney or agent by a showing of authority from such 
person or owner to receive the part of sample. When two or more requests 
for parts of the same sample are received the requests shall be complied 
with in the order in which they were received so long as any part of the 
sample remains available therefor.
    (d) When an official sample of food, drug, or cosmetic is the basis 
of a notice given under section 305 of the act, or of a case under the 
act, and the person to whom the notice was given, or any person who is a 
party to the case, has no right under paragraph (c) of this section to a 
part of the sample, such person or his attorney or agent may obtain a 
part of the sample upon request accompanied by a written waiver of right 
under such paragraph (c) from each person named on the label of the 
article and owner thereof, who has not exercised his right under such 
paragraph (c). The operation of this paragraph shall be subject to the 
exceptions, terms, and conditions prescribed in paragraph (c) of this 
section.
    (e) The Food and Drug Administration is authorized to destroy:
    (1) Any official sample when it determines that no analysis of such 
sample will be made;
    (2) Any official sample or part thereof when it determines that no 
notice under section 305 of the act, and no case under the act, is or 
will be based on such sample;
    (3) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the 
basis of a notice under section 305 of the act, and when, after 
opportunity for presentation of views following such notice, it 
determines that no other such notice, and no case under the act, is or 
will be based on such sample;
    (4) Any official sample or part thereof when the sample was the 
basis of a case under the act which has gone to final judgment, and when 
it determines that no other such case is or will be based on such 
sample;
    (5) Any official sample or part thereof if the article is 
perishable;
    (6) Any official sample or part thereof when, after collection, such 
sample or part has become decomposed or otherwise unfit for analysis;
    (7) That part of any official sample which is in excess of three 
times the quantity it estimates to be sufficient for analysis.

[42 FR 15559, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 63 FR 51299, Sept. 25, 1998]



Sec.  2.19  Methods of analysis.

    Where the method of analysis is not prescribed in a regulation, it 
is the policy of the Food and Drug Administration in its enforcement 
programs to utilize the methods of analysis of the AOAC INTERNATIONAL 
(AOAC) as published in the latest edition (13th Ed., 1980) of their 
publication ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of 
Official Analytical Chemists,'' and the supplements thereto (``Changes 
in Methods'' as published in the March issues of the ``Journal of the 
Association of Official Analytical Chemists''), which are incorporated 
by reference, when available and applicable. Copies are available from 
the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite 500, 
Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or at the National Archives and Records 
Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this 
material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://www.archives.gov/
federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--locations.html. In 
the absence of an AOAC method, the Commissioner will furnish a copy of 
the particular method, or a reference to the published method, that the 
Food and Drug Administration will use in its enforcement program. Other 
methods may be used for quality control, specifications, contracts, 
surveys, and similar nonregulatory functions, but it is expected that 
they will be calibrated in terms of the method which the Food and Drug 
Administration uses in its enforcement program. Use of an AOAC method 
does

[[Page 109]]

not relieve the practioner of the responsibility to demonstrate that he 
can perform the method properly through the use of positive and negative 
controls and recovery and reproducibility studies.

                    Subpart B_Human and Animal Foods



Sec.  2.25  Grain seed treated with poisonous substances; color 
identification to prevent adulteration of human and animal food.

    (a) In recent years there has developed increasing use of poisonous 
treatments on seed for fungicidal and other purposes. Such treated seed, 
if consumed, presents a hazard to humans and livestock. It is not 
unusual for stocks of such treated food seeds to remain on hand after 
the planting season has passed. Despite the cautions required by the 
Federal Seed Act (53 Stat. 1275, as amended 72 Stat. 476, 7 U.S.C. 1551 
et seq.) in the labeling of the treated seed, the Food and Drug 
Administration has encountered many cases where such surplus stocks of 
treated wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum seed had been mixed 
with untreated seed and sent to market for food or feed use. This has 
resulted in livestock injury and in legal actions under the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act against large quantities of food 
adulterated through such admixture of poisonous treated seeds with good 
food. Criminal cases were brought against some firms and individuals. 
Where the treated seeds are prominently colored, buyers and users or 
processors of agricultural food seed for food purposes are able to 
detect the admixture of the poisonous seed and thus reject the lots; but 
most such buyers, users, and processors do not have the facilities or 
scientific equipment to determine the presence of the poisonous chemical 
at the time crops are delivered, in cases where the treated seeds have 
not been so colored. A suitable color for this use is one that is in 
sufficient contrast to the natural color of the food seed as to make 
admixture of treated, denatured seeds with good food easily apparent, 
and is so applied that it is not readily removed.
    (b) On and after December 31, 1964, the Food and Drug Administration 
will regard as adulterated any interstate shipment of the food seeds 
wheat, corn, oats, rye, barley, and sorghum bearing a poisonous 
treatment in excess of a recognized tolerance or treatment for which no 
tolerance or exemption from tolerance is recognized in regulations 
promulgated pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act, unless such seeds have been adequately denatured by a 
suitable color to prevent their subsequent inadvertent use as food for 
man or feed for animals.
    (c) Attention is called to the labeling requirements of the Federal 
Hazardous Substances Act, where applicable to denatured seeds in 
packages suitable for household use.



Sec.  2.35  Use of secondhand containers for the shipment or storage 
of food and animal feed.

    (a) Investigations by the Food and Drug Administration, the National 
Communicable Disease Center of the U.S. Public Health Service, the 
Consumer and Marketing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 
and by various State public health agencies have revealed practices 
whereby food and animal feed stored or shipped in secondhand containers 
have been rendered dangerous to health. Such contamination has been the 
result of the original use of these containers for the storage and 
shipment of articles containing or bearing disease organisms or 
poisonous or deleterious substances.
    (b) The Commissioner concludes that such dangerous or potentially 
dangerous practices include, but are not limited to, the following:
    (1) Some vegetable growers and packers employ used poultry crates 
for shipment of fresh vegetables, including cabbage and celery. 
Salmonella organisms are commonly present on dressed poultry and in 
excreta and fluid exudates from dressed birds. Thus wooden crates in 
which dressed poultry has been iced and packed are potential sources of 
Salmonella or other enteropathogenic microorganisms that

[[Page 110]]

may contaminate fresh vegetables which are frequently consumed without 
heat treatment.
    (2) Some potato growers and producers of animal feeds use secondhand 
bags for shipment of these articles. Such bags may have originally been 
used for shipping or storing pesticide-treated seed or other articles 
bearing or containing poisonous substances. Thus these secondhand bags 
are potential sources of contamination of the food or animal feed stored 
or shipped therein.
    (c) In a policy statement issued April 11, 1968, the Food and Drug 
Administration declared adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a) 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act shipments of vegetables or 
other edible food in used crates or containers that may render the 
contents injurious to health. This policy statement is extended so that 
the Food and Drug Administration will regard as adulterated within the 
meaning of section 402(a) of the act shipments of vegetables, other 
edible food, or animal feed in used crates, bags, or other containers 
that may render the contents injurious to health.

Subparts C-E [Reserved]



                        Subpart F_Caustic Poisons



Sec.  2.110  Definition of ammonia under Federal Caustic Poison Act.

    For the purpose of determining whether an article containing ammonia 
is subject to the Federal Caustic Poison Act, the ammonia content is to 
be calculated as NH3.



  Subpart G_Provisions Applicable to Specific Products Subject to the 
                  Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act



Sec.  2.125  Use of ozone-depleting substances in foods, drugs, 
devices, or cosmetics.

    (a) As used in this section, ozone-depleting substance (ODS) means 
any class I substance as defined in 40 CFR part 82, appendix A to 
subpart A, or class II substance as defined in 40 CFR part 82, appendix 
B to subpart A.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, any food, 
drug, device, or cosmetic that is, consists in part of, or is contained 
in an aerosol product or other pressurized dispenser that releases an 
ODS is not an essential use of the ODS under the Clean Air Act.
    (c) A food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is, consists in part of, 
or is contained in an aerosol product or other pressurized dispenser 
that releases an ODS is an essential use of the ODS under the Clean Air 
Act if paragraph (e) of this section specifies the use of that product 
as essential. For drugs, including biologics and animal drugs, and for 
devices, an investigational application or an approved marketing 
application must be in effect, as applicable.
    (d) [Reserved]
    (e) The use of ODSs in the following products is essential:
    (1) Metered-dose corticosteroid human drugs for oral inhalation. 
Oral pressurized metered-dose inhalers containing the following active 
moieties:
    (i)-(v) [Reserved]
    (2) Metered-dose short-acting adrenergic bronchodilator human drugs 
for oral inhalation. Oral pressurized metered-dose inhalers containing 
the following active moieties:
    (i)-(v) [Reserved]
    (3) [Reserved]
    (4) Other essential uses. (i)-(ii) [Reserved]
    (iii) Anesthetic drugs for topical use on accessible mucous 
membranes of humans where a cannula is used for application.
    (iv)-(v) [Reserved]
    (vi) Metered-dose atropine sulfate aerosol human drugs administered 
by oral inhalation.
    (vii)-(viii) [Reserved]
    (ix) Sterile aerosol talc administered intrapleurally by 
thoracoscopy for human use.
    (f) Any person may file a petition under part 10 of this chapter to 
request that FDA initiate rulemaking to amend paragraph (e) of this 
section to add an essential use. FDA may initiate notice-and-comment 
rulemaking to add an essential use on its own initiative or in response 
to a petition, if granted.

[[Page 111]]

    (1) If the petition is to add use of a noninvestigational product, 
the petitioner must submit compelling evidence that:
    (i) Substantial technical barriers exist to formulating the product 
without ODSs;
    (ii) The product will provide an unavailable important public health 
benefit; and
    (iii) Use of the product does not release cumulatively significant 
amounts of ODSs into the atmosphere or the release is warranted in view 
of the unavailable important public health benefit.
    (2) If the petition is to add use of an investigational product, the 
petitioner must submit compelling evidence that:
    (i) Substantial technical barriers exist to formulating the 
investigational product without ODSs;
    (ii) A high probability exists that the investigational product will 
provide an unavailable important public health benefit; and
    (iii) Use of the investigational product does not release 
cumulatively significant amounts of ODSs into the atmosphere or the 
release is warranted in view of the high probability of an unavailable 
important public health benefit.
    (g) Any person may file a petition under part 10 of this chapter to 
request that FDA initiate rulemaking to amend paragraph (e) of this 
section to remove an essential use. FDA may initiate notice-and-comment 
rulemaking to remove an essential use on its own initiative or in 
response to a petition, if granted. If the petition is to remove an 
essential use from paragraph (e) of this section, the petitioner must 
submit compelling evidence of any one of the following criteria:
    (1) The product using an ODS is no longer being marketed; or
    (2) After January 1, 2005, FDA determines that the product using an 
ODS no longer meets the criteria in paragraph (f) of this section after 
consultation with a relevant advisory committee(s) and after an open 
public meeting; or
    (3) For individual active moieties marketed as ODS products and 
represented by one new drug application (NDA):
    (i) At least one non-ODS product with the same active moiety is 
marketed with the same route of administration, for the same indication, 
and with approximately the same level of convenience of use as the ODS 
product containing that active moiety;
    (ii) Supplies and production capacity for the non-ODS product(s) 
exist or will exist at levels sufficient to meet patient need;
    (iii) Adequate U.S. postmarketing use data is available for the non-

    Subpart A_Assignment of Agency Component for Review of Premarket 
                              Applications



Sec.  3.1  Purpose.

    This regulation relates to agency management and organization and 
has two purposes. The first is to implement section 503(g) of the act, 
as added by section 16 of the Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 (Public 
Law 101-629) and amended by section 204 of the Medical Device User Fee 
and Modernization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-250), by specifying how 
FDA will determine the organizational component within FDA designated to 
have primary jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of 
products that are comprised of any combination of a drug and a device; a 
device and a biological; a biological and a drug; or a drug, a device 
and a biological. This determination will eliminate, in most cases, the 
need to receive approvals from more than one FDA component for such 
combination products. The second purpose of this regulation is to 
enhance the efficiency of agency management and operations by providing 
procedures for determining which agency component will have primary 
jurisdiction for any drug, device, or biological product where such 
jurisdiction is unclear or in dispute. Nothing in this section prevents 
FDA from using any agency resources it deems necessary to ensure 
adequate review of the safety and effectiveness of any product, or the 
substantial equivalence of any device to a predicate device.

[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 68 FR 37077, June 23, 2003]



Sec.  3.2  Definitions.

    For the purpose of this part:
    (a) Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (b) Agency component means the Center for Biologics Evaluation and 
Research, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Center for 
Drug Evaluation and Research, or alternative organizational component of 
the agency.
    (c) Applicant means any person who submits or plans to submit an 
application to the Food and Drug Administration for premarket review. 
For purposes of this section, the terms ``sponsor'' and ``applicant'' 
have the same meaning.
    (d) Biological product has the meaning given the term in section 
351(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).
    (e) Combination product includes:
    (1) A product comprised of two or more regulated components, i.e., 
drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic, or drug/device/biologic, 
that are physically, chemically, or otherwise combined or mixed and 
produced as a single entity;
    (2) Two or more separate products packaged together in a single 
package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device 
and biological products, or biological and drug products;
    (3) A drug, device, or biological product packaged separately that 
according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended 
for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device, or 
biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, 
indication, or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product 
the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, e.g., to 
reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of 
administration, or significant change in dose; or
    (4) Any investigational drug, device, or biological product packaged 
separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with 
another individually specified investigational drug, device, or 
biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, 
indication, or effect.
    (f) Device has the meaning given the term in section 201(h) of the 
act.
    (g) Drug has the meaning given the term in section 201(g)(1) of the 
act.
    (h) FDA means Food and Drug Administration.
    (i) Letter of designation means the written notice issued by the 
product jurisdiction officer specifying the agency component with 
primary jurisdiction for a combination product.

[[Page 113]]

    (j) Letter of request means an applicant's written submission to the 
product jurisdiction officer seeking the designation of the agency 
component with primary jurisdiction.
    (k) Mode of action is the means by which a product achieves an 
intended therapeutic effect or action. For purposes of this definition, 
``therapeutic'' action or effect includes any effect or action of the 
combination product intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or 
prevent disease, or affect the structure or any function of the body. 
When making assignments of combination products under this part, the 
agency will consider three types of mode of action: The actions provided 
by a biological product, a device, and a drug. Because combination 
products are comprised of more than one type of regulated article 
(biological product, device, or drug), and each constituent part 
contributes a biological product, device, or drug mode of action, 
combination products will typically have more than one identifiable mode 
of action.
    (1) A constituent part has a biological product mode of action if it 
acts by means of a virus, therapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, vaccine, 
blood, blood component or derivative, allergenic product, or analogous 
product applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or 
condition of human beings, as described in section 351(i) of the Public 
Health Service Act.
    (2) A constituent part has a device mode of action if it meets the 
definition of device contained in section 201(h)(1) to (h)(3) of the 
act, it does not have a biological product mode of action, and it does 
not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within 
or on the body of man or other animals and is not dependent upon being 
metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.
    (3) A constituent part has a drug mode of action if it meets the 
definition of drug contained in section 201(g)(1) of the act and it does 
not have a biological product or device mode of action.
    (l) Premarket review includes the examination of data and 
information in an application for premarket review described in sections 
505, 510(k), 513(f), 515, or 520(g) or 520(l) of the act or section 351 
of the Public Health Service Act of data and information contained in 
any investigational new drug (IND) application, investigational device 
exemption (IDE), new drug application (NDA), biologics license 
application, device premarket notification, device reclassification 
petition, and premarket approval application (PMA).
    (m) Primary mode of action is the single mode of action of a 
combination product that provides the most important therapeutic action 
of the combination product. The most important therapeutic action is the 
mode of action expected to make the greatest contribution to the overall 
intended therapeutic effects of the combination product.
    (n) Product means any article that contains any drug as defined in 
section 201(g)(1) of the act; any device as defined in section 201(h) of 
the act; or any biologic as defined in section 351(a) of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 262(a)).
    (o) Product jurisdiction officer is the person or persons 
responsible for designating the component of FDA with primary 
jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination 
product or any product requiring a jurisdictional designation under this 
part.
    (p) Sponsor means ``applicant'' (see Sec.  3.2(c)).

Sec.  3.3  Scope.

    This section applies to:
    (a) Any combination product, or
    (b) Any product where the agency component with primary jurisdiction 
is unclear or in dispute.



Sec.  3.4  Designated agency component.

    (a) To designate the agency component with primary jurisdiction for 
the premarket review and regulation of a combination product, the agency 
shall determine the primary mode of action of the product. Where the 
primary mode of action is that of:

[[Page 114]]

    (1) A drug (other than a biological product), the agency component 
charged with premarket review of drugs shall have primary jurisdiction;
    (2) A device, the agency component charged with premarket review of 
devices shall have primary jurisdiction;
    (3) A biological product, the agency component charged with 
premarket review of biological products shall have primary jurisdiction.
    (b) In some situations, it is not possible to determine, with 
reasonable certainty, which one mode of action will provide a greater 
contribution than any other mode of action to the overall therapeutic 
effects of the combination product. In such a case, the agency will 
assign the combination product to the agency component that regulates 
other combination products that present similar questions of safety and 
effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a whole. When 
there are no other combination products that present similar questions 
of safety and effectiveness with regard to the combination product as a 
whole, the agency will assign the combination product to the agency 
component with the most expertise related to the most significant safety 
and effectiveness questions presented by the combination product.
    (c) The designation of one agency component as having primary 
jurisdiction for the premarket review and regulation of a combination 
product does not preclude consultations by that component with other 
agency components or, in appropriate cases, the requirement by FDA of 
separate applications.

[56 FR 58756, Nov. 21, 1991, as amended at 70 FR 49861, Aug. 25, 2005]

Research and the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.'' The 
availability of any amendments to these intercenter agreements will be 
announced by Federal Register notice.
    (2) These guidance documents describe the allocation of 
responsibility for categories of products or specific products. These 
intercenter agreements, and any amendments thereto, are nonbinding 
determinations designed to provide useful guidance to the public.
    (3) The sponsor of a premarket application or required 
investigational filing for a combination or other product covered by 
these guidance documents may contact the designated agency component 
identified in the intercenter agreement before submitting an application 
of premarket review or to confirm coverage and to discuss the 
application process.
    (b) For a combination product not covered by a guidance document or 
for a product where the agency component with primary jurisdiction is 
unclear or in dispute, the sponsor of an application for premarket 
review should follow the procedures set forth in Sec.  3.7 to request a 
designation of the agency component with primary jurisdiction before 
submitting the application.

 Subpart C_Recalls (Including Product Corrections)_Guidance on Policy, 
                Procedures, and Industry Responsibilities

    Source: 43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  7.40  Recall policy.

    (a) Recall is an effective method of removing or correcting consumer 
products that are in violation of laws administered by the Food and Drug 
Administration. Recall is a voluntary action that takes place because 
manufacturers and distributors carry out their responsibility to protect 
the public health and well-being from products that present a risk of 
injury or gross deception or are otherwise defective. This section and 
Sec. Sec.  7.41 through 7.59 recognize the voluntary nature of recall by 
providing guidance so that responsible firms may effectively discharge 
their recall responsibilities. These sections also recognize that recall 
is an alternative to a Food and Drug Administration-initiated court 
action for removing or correcting violative, distributed products by 
setting forth specific recall procedures for the Food and Drug 
Administration to monitor recalls and assess the adequacy of a firm's 
efforts in recall.
    (b) Recall may be undertaken voluntarily and at any time by 
manufacturers and distributors, or at the request of the Food and Drug 
Administration. A request by the Food and Drug Administration that a 
firm recall a product is reserved for urgent situations and is to be 
directed to the firm that has primary responsibility for the manufacture 
and marketing of the product that is to be recalled.
    (c) Recall is generally more appropriate and affords better 
protection for consumers than seizure, when many lots of product have 
been widely distributed. Seizure, multiple seizure, or other court 
action is indicated when a firm refuses to undertake a recall requested 
by the Food and Drug Administration, or where the agency has reason to 
believe that a recall would not be effective, determines that a recall 
is ineffective, or discovers that a violation is continuing.

Sec.  7.41  Health hazard evaluation and recall classification.

    (a) An evaluation of the health hazard presented by a product being 
recalled or considered for recall will be conducted by an ad hoc 
committee of Food and Drug Administration scientists and will take into 
account, but need not be limited to, the following factors:
    (1) Whether any disease or injuries have already occurred from the 
use of the product.
    (2) Whether any existing conditions could contribute to a clinical 
situation that could expose humans or animals to a health hazard. Any 
conclusion shall be supported as completely as possible by scientific 
documentation and/or statements that the conclusion is the opinion of 
the individual(s) making the health hazard determination.
    (3) Assessment of hazard to various segments of the population, 
e.g., children, surgical patients, pets, livestock,

[[Page 129]]

etc., who are expected to be exposed to the product being considered, 
with particular attention paid to the hazard to those individuals who 
may be at greatest risk.
    (4) Assessment of the degree of seriousness of the health hazard to 
which the populations at risk would be exposed.
    (5) Assessment of the likelihood of occurrence of the hazard.
    (6) Assessment of the consequences (immediate or long-range) of 
occurrence of the hazard.
    (b) On the basis of this determination, the Food and Drug 
Administration will assign the recall a classification, i.e., Class I, 
Class II, or Class III, to indicate the relative degree of health hazard 
of the product being recalled or considered for recall.



Sec.  7.42  Recall strategy.

    (a) General. (1) A recall strategy that takes into account the 
following factors will be developed by the agency for a Food and Drug 
Administration-requested recall and by the recalling firm for a firm-
initiated recall to suit the individual circumstances of the particular 
recall:
    (i) Results of health hazard evaluation.
    (ii) Ease in identifying the product.
    (iii) Degree to which the product's deficiency is obvious to the 
consumer or user.
    (iv) Degree to which the product remains unused in the market-place.
    (v) Continued availability of essential products.
    (2) The Food and Drug Administration will review the adequacy of a 
proposed recall strategy developed by a recalling firm and recommend 
changes as appropriate. A recalling firm should conduct the recall in 
accordance with an approved recall strategy but need not delay 
initiation of a recall pending review of its recall strategy.
    (b) Elements of a recall strategy. A recall strategy will address 
the following elements regarding the conduct of the recall:
    (1) Depth of recall. Depending on the product's degree of hazard and 
extent of distribution, the recall strategy will specify the level in 
the distribution chain to which the recall is to extend, as follows:
    (i) Consumer or user level, which may vary with product, including 
any intermediate wholesale or retail level; or
    (ii) Retail level, including any intermediate wholesale level; or
    (iii) Wholesale level.
    (2) Public warning. The purpose of a public warning is to alert the 
public that a product being recalled presents a serious hazard to 
health. It is reserved for urgent situations where other means for 
preventing use of the recalled product appear inadequate. The Food and 
Drug Administration in consultation with the recalling firm will 
ordinarily issue such publicity. The recalling firm that decides to 
issue its own public warning is requested to submit its proposed public 
warning and plan for distribution of the warning for review and comment 
by the Food and Drug Administration. The recall strategy will specify 
whether a public warning is needed and whether it will issue as:
    (i) General public warning through the general news media, either 
national or local as appropriate, or
    (ii) Public warning through specialized news media, e.g., 
professional or trade press, or to specific segments of the population 
such as physicians, hospitals, etc.
    (3) Effectiveness checks. The purpose of effectiveness checks is to 
verify that all consignees at the recall depth specified by the strategy 
have received notification about the recall and have taken appropriate 
action. The method for contacting consignees may be accomplished by 
personal visits, telephone calls, letters, or a combination thereof. A 
guide entitled ``Methods for Conducting Recall Effectiveness Checks'' 
that describes the use of these different methods is available upon 
request from the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug 
Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The 
recalling firm will ordinarily be responsible for conducting 
effectiveness checks, but the Food and Drug Administration will assist 
in this task where necessary and appropriate. The recall strategy will 
specify the method(s) to be used for

[[Page 130]]

and the level of effectiveness checks that will be conducted, as 
follows:
    (i) Level A--100 percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted;
    (ii) Level B--Some percentage of the total number of consignees to 
be contacted, which percentage is to be determined on a case-by-case 
basis, but is greater that 10 percent and less than 100 percent of the 
total number of consignees;
    (iii) Level C--10 percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted;
    (iv) Level D--2 percent of the total number of consignees to be 
contacted; or
    (v) Level E--No effectiveness checks.

[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 46 FR 8455, Jan. 27, 1981; 59 
FR 14363, Mar. 28, 1994; 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003]



Sec.  7.45  Food and Drug Administration-requested recall.

    (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or designee may request a 
firm to initiate a recall when the following determinations have been 
made:
    (1) That a product that has been distributed presents a risk of 
illness or injury or gross consumer deception.
    (2) That the firm has not initiated a recall of the product.
    (3) That an agency action is necessary to protect the public health 
and welfare.
    (b) The Commissioner or his designee will notify the firm of this 
determination and of the need to begin immediately a recall of the 
product. Such notification will be by letter or telegram to a 
responsible official of the firm, but may be preceded by oral 
communication or by a visit from an authorized representative of the 
local Food and Drug Administration district office, with formal, written 
confirmation from the Commissioner or his designee afterward. The 
notification will specify the violation, the health hazard 
classification of the violative product, the recall strategy, and other 
appropriate instructions for conducting the recall.
    (c) Upon receipt of a request to recall, the firm may be asked to 
provide the Food and Drug Administration any or all of the information 
listed in Sec.  7.46(a). The firm, upon agreeing to the recall request, 
may also provide other information relevant to the agency's 
determination of the need for the recall or how the recall should be 
conducted.

[43 FR 26218, June 16, 1978, as amended at 69 FR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004]



Sec.  7.46  Firm-initiated recall.

    (a) A firm may decide of its own volition and under any 
circumstances to remove or correct a distributed product. A firm that 
does so because it believes the product to be violative is requested to 
notify immediately the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district 
office listed in Sec.  5.115 of this chapter. Such removal or correction 
will be considered a recall only if the Food and Drug Administration 
regards the product as involving a violation that is subject to legal 
action, e.g., seizure. In such cases, the firm will be asked to provide 
the Food and Drug Administration the following information:
    (1) Identity of the product involved.
    (2) Reason for the removal or correction and the date and 
circumstances under which the product deficiency or possible deficiency 
was discovered.
    (3) Evaluation of the risk associated with the deficiency or 
possible deficiency.
    (4) Total amount of such products produced and/or the timespan of 
the production.
    (5) Total amount of such products estimated to be in distribution 
channels.
    (6) Distribution information, including the number of direct 
accounts and, where necessary, the identity of the direct accounts.
    (7) A copy of the firm's recall communication if any has issued, or 
a proposed communication if none has issued.
    (8) Proposed strategy for conducting the recall.
    (9) Name and telephone number of the firm official who should be 
contacted concerning the recall.
    (b) The Food and Drug Administration will review the information 
submitted, advise the firm of the assigned recall classification, 
recommend any appropriate changes in the firm's strategy for the recall, 
and advise the firm that its recall will be placed in the weekly FDA 
Enforcement Report.

[[Page 131]]

Pending this review, the firm need not delay initiation of its product 
removal or correction.
    (c) A firm may decide to recall a product when informed by the Food 
and Drug Administration that the agency has determined that the product 
in question violates the law, but the agency has not specifically 
requested a recall. The firm's action also is considered a firm-
initiated recall and is subject to paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section.
    (d) A firm that initiates a removal or correction of its product 
which the firm believes is a market withdrawal should consult with the 
appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office when the reason 
for the removal or correction is not obvious or clearly understood but 
where it is apparent, e.g., because of complaints or adverse reactions 
regarding the product, that the product is deficient in some respect. In 
such cases, the Food and Drug Administration will assist the firm in 
determining the exact nature of the problem.



Sec.  7.49  Recall communications.

    (a) General. A recalling firm is responsible for promptly notifying 
each of its affected direct accounts about the recall. The format, 
content, and extent of a recall communication should be commensurate 
with the hazard of the product being recalled and the strategy developed 
for that recall. In general terms, the purpose of a recall communication 
is to convey:
    (1) That the product in question is subject to a recall.
    (2) That further distribution or use of any remaining product should 
cease immediately.
    (3) Where appropriate, that the direct account should in turn notify 
its customers who received the product about the recall.
    (4) Instructions regarding what to do with the product.
    (b) Implementation. A recall communication can be accomplished by 
telegrams, mailgrams, or first class letters conspicuously marked, 
preferably in bold red type, on the letter and the envelope: ``drug [or 
food, biologic, etc.] recall [or correction]''. The letter and the 
envelope should be also marked: ``urgent'' for class I and class II 
recalls and, when appropriate, for class III recalls. Telephone calls or 
other personal contacts should ordinarily be confirmed by one of the 
above methods and/or documented in an appropriate manner.
    (c) Contents. (1) A recall communication should be written in 
accordance with the following guidelines:
    (i) Be brief and to the point;
    (ii) Identify clearly the product, size, lot number(s), code(s) or 
serial number(s) and any other pertinent descriptive information to 
enable accurate and immediate identification of the product;
    (iii) Explain concisely the reason for the recall and the hazard 
involved, if any;
    (iv) Provide specific instructions on what should be done with 
respect to the recalled products; and
    (v) Provide a ready means for the recipient of the communication to 
report to the recalling firm whether it has any of the product, e.g., by 
sending a postage-paid, self-addressed postcard or by allowing the 
recipient to place a collect call to the recalling firm.
    (2) The recall communication should not contain irrelevant 
qualifications, promotional materials, or any other statement that may 
detract from the message. Where necessary, followup communications 
should be sent to those who fail to respond to the initial recall 
communication.
    (d) Responsibility of recipient. Consignees that receive a recall 
communication should immediately carry out the instructions set forth by 
the recalling firm and, where necessary, extend the recall to its 
consignees in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.



Sec.  7.50  Public notification of recall.

    The Food and Drug Administration will promptly make available to the 
public in the weekly FDA Enforcement Report a descriptive listing of 
each new recall according to its classification, whether it was Food and 
Drug Administration-requested or firm-initiated, and the specific action 
being taken by the recalling firm. The Food and Drug Administration will 
intentionally delay public notification of recalls of

[[Page 132]]

certain drugs and devices where the agency determines that public 
notification may cause unnecessary and harmful anxiety in patients and 
that initial consultation between patients and their physicians is 
essential. The report will not include a firm's product removals or 
corrections which the agency determines to be market withdrawals or 
stock recoveries. The report, which also includes other Food and Drug 
Administration regulatory actions, e.g., seizures that were effected and 
injunctions and prosecutions that were filed, is available upon request 
from the Office of Public Affairs (HFI-1), Food and Drug Administration, 
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.



Sec.  7.53  Recall status reports.

    (a) The recalling firm is requested to submit periodic recall status 
reports to the appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office 
so that the agency may assess the progress of the recall. The frequency 
of such reports will be determined by the relative urgency of the recall 
and will be specified by the Food and Drug Administration in each recall 
case; generally the reporting interval will be between 2 and 4 weeks.
    (b) Unless otherwise specified or inappropriate in a given recall 
case, the recall status report should contain the following information:
    (1) Number of consignees notified of the recall, and date and method 
of notification.
    (2) Number of consignees responding to the recall communication and 
quatity of products on hand at the time it was received.
    (3) Number of consignees that did not respond (if needed, the 
identity of nonresponding consignees may be requested by the Food and 
Drug Administration).
    (4) Number of products returned or corrected by each consignee 
contacted and the quantity of products accounted for.
    (5) Number and results of effectiveness checks that were made.
    (6) Estimated time frames for completion of the recall.
    (c) Recall status reports are to be discontinued when the recall is 
terminated by the Food and Drug Administration.



Sec.  7.55  Termination of a recall.

    (a) A recall will be terminated when the Food and Drug 
Administration determines that all reasonable efforts have been made to 
remove or correct the product in accordance with the recall strategy, 
and when it is reasonable to assume that the product subject to the 
recall has been removed and proper disposition or correction has been 
made commensurate with the degree of hazard of the recalled product. 
Written notification that a recall is terminated will be issued by the 
appropriate Food and Drug Administration district office to the 
recalling firm.
    (b) A recalling firm may request termination of its recall by 
submitting a written request to the appropriate Food and Drug 
Adminstration district office stating that the recall is effective in 
accordance with the criteria set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, 
and by accompanying the request with the most current recall status 
report and a description of the disposition of the recalled product.



Sec.  7.59  General industry guidance.

    A recall can be disruptive of a firm's operation and business, but 
there are several steps a prudent firm can take in advance to minimize 
this disruptive effect. Notwithstanding similar specific requirements 
for certain products in other parts of this chapter, the following is 
provided by the Food and Drug Administration as guidance for a firm's 
consideration:
    (a) Prepare and maintain a current written contingency plan for use 
in initiating and effecting a recall in accordance with Sec. Sec.  7.40 
through 7.49, 7.53, and 7.55.
    (b) Use sufficient coding of regulated products to make possible 
positive lot identification and to facilitate effective recall of all 
violative lots.
    (c) Maintain such product distribution records as are necessary to 
facilitate location of products that are being recalled. Such records 
should be maintained for a period of time that exceeds the shelf life 
and expected use of the product and is at least the length of

[[Page 133]]

time specified in other applicable regulations concerning records 
retention.

Subpart D [Reserved]



                      Subpart E_Criminal Violations



Sec.  7.84  Opportunity for presentation of views before report of
criminal violation.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section, a person against whom criminal prosecution under the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is contemplated by the Commissioner of Food 
and Drugs shall be given appropriate notice and an opportunity to 
present information and views to show cause why criminal prosecution 
should not be recommended to a United States attorney.
    (2) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner 
has reason to believe that they may result in the alteration or 
destruction of evidence or in the prospective defendant's fleeing to 
avoid prosecution.
    (3) Notice and opportunity need not be provided if the Commissioner 
contemplates recommending further investigation by the Department of 
Justice.
    (b) If a statute enforced by the Commissioner does not contain a 
provision for an opportunity to present views, the Commissioner need 
not, but may in the Commissioner's discretion, provide notice and an 
opportunity to present views.
    (c) If an apparent violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act also constitutes a violation of any other Federal statute(s), and 
the Commissioner contemplates recommending prosecution under such other 
statute(s) as well, the notice of opportunity to present views will 
include all violations.
    (d) Notice of an opportunity to present views may be by letter, 
standard form, or other document(s) identifying the products and/or 
conduct alleged to violate the law. The notice shall--
    (1) Be sent by registered or certified mail, telegram, telex, 
personal delivery, or any other appropriate mode of written 
communication;
    (2) Specify the time and place where those named may present their 
views;
    (3) Summarize the violations that constitute the basis of the 
contemplated prosecution;
    (4) Describe the purpose and procedure of the presentation; and
    (5) Furnish a form on which the legal status of any person named in 
the notice may be designated.
    (e) If more than one person is named in a notice, a separate 
opportunity for presentation of views shall be scheduled on request. 
Otherwise, the time and place specified in a notice may be changed only 
upon a showing of reasonable grounds. A request for any change shall be 
addressed to the Food and Drug Administration office that issued the 
notice and shall be received in that office at least 3 working days 
before the date set in the notice.
    (f) A person who has received a notice is under no legal obligation 
to appear or answer in any manner. A person choosing to respond may 
appear personally, with or without a representative, or may designate a 
representative to appear for him or her. Alternatively, a person may 
respond in writing. If a person elects not to respond on or before the 
time scheduled, the Commissioner will, without further notice, decide 
whether to recommend criminal prosecution to a United States attorney on 
the basis of the information available.
    (g) If a respondent chooses to appear solely by designated 
representative, that representative shall present a signed statement of 
authorization. If a representative appears for more than one respondent, 
the representative shall submit independent documentation of authority 
to act for each respondent. If a representative appears without written 
authorization, the opportunity to present views with respect to that 
respondent may be provided at that time only if the authenticity of the 
representative's authority is first verified by telephone or other 
appropriate means.

[44 FR 12167, Mar. 6, 1979]



Sec.  7.85  Conduct of a presentation of views before report of
criminal violation.

    (a) The presentation of views shall be heard by a designated Food 
and Drug Administration employee. Other Food

[[Page 134]]

and Drug Administration employees may be present.
    (b) A presentation of views shall not be open to the public. The 
agency employee designated to receive views will permit participation of 
other persons only if they appear with the respondent or the 
respondent's designated representative, and at the request of, and on 
behalf of, the respondent.
    (c) A respondent may present any information of any kind bearing on 
the Commissioner's determination to recommend prosecution. Information 
may include statements of persons appearing on the respondent's behalf, 
letters, documents, laboratory analyses, if applicable, or other 
relevant information or arguments. The opportunity to present views 
shall be informal. The rules of evidence shall not apply. Any 
information given by a respondent, including statements by the 
respondent, shall become part of the agency's records concerning the 
matter and may be used for any official purpose. The Food and Drug 
Administration is under no obligation to present evidence or witnesses.
    (d) If the respondent holds a ``guaranty or undertaking'' as 
described in section 303(c) of the act (21 U.S.C. 333(c)) that is 
applicable to the notice, that document, or a verified copy of it, may 
be presented by the respondent.
    (e) A respondent may have an oral presentation recorded and 
transcribed at his or her expense, in which case a copy of the 
transcription shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration 
office from which the notice issued. The employee designated to receive 
views may order a presentation of views recorded and transcribed at 
agency expense, in which case a copy of such transcription shall be 
provided to each respondent.
    (f) If an oral presentation is not recorded and transcribed, the 
agency employee designated to receive views shall dictate a written 
summary of the presentation. A copy of the summary shall be provided to 
each respondent.
    (g) A respondent may comment on the summary or may supplement any 
response by additional written or documentary evidence. Any comment or 
addition shall be furnished to the Food and Drug Administration office 
where the respondent's views were presented. If materials are submitted 
within 10 calendar days after receipt of the copy of the summary or 
transcription of the presentation, as applicable, they will be 
considered before a final decision as to whether or not to recommend 
prosecution. Any materials received after the supplemental response 
period generally will be considered only if the final agency decision 
has not yet been made.
    (h)(1) When consideration of a criminal prosecution recommendation 
involving the same violations is closed by the Commissioner with respect 
to all persons named in the notice, the Commissioner will so notify each 
person in writing.
    (2) When it is determined that a person named in a notice will not 
be included in the Commissioner's recommendation for criminal 
prosecution, the Commissioner will so notify that person, if and when 
the Commissioner concludes that notification will not prejudice the 
prosecution of any other person.
    (3) When a United States attorney informs the agency that no persons 
recommended will be prosecuted, the Commissioner will so notify each 
person in writing, unless the United States attorney has already done 
so.
    (4) When a United States attorney informs the agency of intent to 
prosecute some, but not all, persons who had been provided an 
opportunity to present views and were subsequently named in the 
Commissioner's recommendation for criminal prosecution, the 
Commissioner, after being advised by the United States attorney that the 
notification will not prejudice the prosecution of any other person, 
will so notify those persons eliminated from further consideration, 
unless the United States attorney has already done so.

[44 FR 12168, Mar. 6, 1979]



Sec.  7.87  Records related to opportunities for presentation of 
views conducted before report of criminal violation.

    (a) Records related to a section 305 opportunity for presentation of 
views constitute investigatory records for

[[Page 135]]

law enforcement purposes and may include inter- and intra-agency 
memorandums.
    (1) Notwithstanding the rule established in Sec.  20.21 of this 
chapter, no record related to a section 305 presentation is available 
for public disclosure until consideration of criminal prosecution has 
been closed in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, except as 
provided in Sec.  20.82 of this chapter. Only very rarely and only under 
circumstances that demonstrate a compelling public interest will the 
Commissioner exercise, in accordance with Sec.  20.82 of this chapter, 
the authorized discretion to disclose records related to a section 305 
presentation before the consideration of criminal prosecution is closed.
    (2) After consideration of criminal prosecution is closed, the 
records are available for public disclosure in response to a request 
under the Freedom of Information Act, except to the extent that the 
exemptions from disclosure in subpart D of part 20 of this chapter are 
applicable. No statements obtained through promises of confidentiality 
shall be available for public disclosure.
    (b) Consideration of criminal prosecution based on a particular 
section 305 notice of opportunity for presentation of views shall be 
deemed to be closed within the meaning of this section and Sec.  7.85 
when a final decision has been made not to recommend criminal 
prosecution to a United States attorney based on charges set forth in 
the notice and considered at the presentation, or when such a 
recommendation has been finally refused by the United States attorney, 
or when criminal prosecution has been instituted and the matter and all 
related appeals have been concluded, or when the statute of limitations 
has run.
    (c) Before disclosure of any record specifically reflecting 
consideration of a possible recommendation for criminal prosecution of 
any individual, all names and other information that would identify an 
individual whose prosecution was considered but not recommended, or who 
was not prosecuted, shall be deleted, unless the Commissioner concludes 
that there is a compelling public interest in the disclosure of the 
names.
    (d) Names and other information that would identify a Food and Drug 
Administration employee shall be deleted from records related to a 
section 305 presentation of views before public disclosure only under 
Sec.  20.32 of this chapter.

petition, comment, objection, notice, compilation of information, or any 
other document is to be filed in four copies except as otherwise 
specifically provided in a relevant Federal Register notice or in 
another section of this chapter. The Division of Dockets Management is 
the agency custodian of these documents.
    (b) A submission is to be signed by the person making it, or by an 
attorney or other authorized representative of that person. Submissions 
by trade associations are also subject to the requirements of Sec.  
10.105(b).
    (c) Information referred to or relied upon in a submission is to be 
included in full and may not be incorporated by reference, unless 
previously submitted in the same proceeding.

included, except where the reference or source is:
    (i) A reported Federal court case;
    (ii) A Federal law or regulation;
    (iii) An FDA document that is routinely publicly available; or
    (iv) A recognized medical or scientific textbook that is readily

    (3) Where relevant information is contained in a document also 
containing irrelevant information, the irrelevant information is to be 
deleted and only the relevant information is to be submitted.
    (4) Under Sec.  20.63 (a) and (b), the names and other information 
that would identify patients or research subjects are to be deleted from 
any record before it is submitted to the Division of Dockets Management 
in order to preclude a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
    (5) Defamatory, scurrilous, or intemperate matter is to be deleted 
from a record before it is submitted to the Division of Dockets 
Management.
    (6) The failure to comply with the requirements of this part or with

Division of Dockets Management, the Division of Dockets Management shall 
not file the submission but return it with a copy of the applicable 
regulations indicating those provisions not complied with. A deficient 
submission may be corrected or supplemented and subsequently filed. The 
office of the Division of Dockets Management does not make decisions 
regarding the confidentiality of submitted documents.
    (d) The filing of a submission means only that the Division of 
Dockets Management has identified no technical deficiencies in the 
submission. The filing of a petition does not mean or imply

[[Page 139]]

that it meets all applicable requirements or that it contains reasonable 
grounds for the action requested or that the action requested is in 
accordance with law.
    (e) All submissions to the Division of Dockets Management will be 
considered as submitted on the date they are postmarked or, if delivered 
in person during regular business hours, on the date they are delivered, 
unless a provision in this part, an applicable Federal Register notice, 
or an order issued by an administrative law judge specifically states 
that the documents must be received by a specified date, e.g., Sec.  
10.33(g) relating to a petition for reconsideration, in which case they 
will be considered submitted on the date received.
    (f) All submissions are to be mailed or delivered in person to the 
Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 5630 
Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

documents, except:
    (1) Documents delivered in person or by certified or registered mail

provided by regulation or by customary practice, e.g., Sec.  10.30(c) 
relating to a citizen petition.
    (h) Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays are included in 
computing the time allowed for the submission of documents, except that 
when the time for submission expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal 
legal holiday, the period will be extended to include the next business 
day.
    (i) All submissions to the Division of Dockets Management are 
representations that, to the best of the knowledge, information, and 
belief of the person making the submission, the statements made in the 
submission are true and accurate. All submissions are subject to the 
False Reports to the Government Act (18 U.S.C. 1001) under which a 
willfully false statement is a criminal offense.
    (j) The availability for public examination and copying of 
submissions to the Division of Dockets Management is governed by the 
following rules:
    (1) Except to the extent provided in paragraphs (j)(2) and (3) of 
this section, the following submissions, including all supporting 
material, will be on public display and will be available for public

    (2)(i) Material prohibited from public disclosure under Sec.  20.63 
(clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy) and, except as 
provided in paragraph (j)(3) of this section, material submitted with 
objections and requests for hearing filed under part 12, or at a hearing 
under part 12 or part 13, or an alternative form of public hearing 
before a public advisory committee or a hearing under Sec.  12.32(a) (2) 
or (3), of the following types will not be on public display, will not 
be available for public examination, and will not be available for

    (e) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
    (f) Information on product design or construction.
    (ii) Material submitted under paragraph (j)(2) of this section is to 
be segregated from all other submitted material and clearly so marked. A

paragraph (j)(2) may request a ruling from the Associate Commissioner 
for Public Affairs whose decision is final, subject to judicial review 
under Sec.  20.48.
    (3) Material listed in paragraph (j)(2)(i) (a) and (b) of this 
section may be disclosed under a protective order issued by the 
administrative law judge or other presiding officer at a hearing 
referenced in paragraph (j)(2)(i). The administrative law judge or 
presiding officer shall permit disclosure of the data only in camera and 
only to the extent necessary for the proper conduct of the hearing. The 
administrative law judge or presiding officer shall direct to whom the 
information is to be made available (e.g., to parties or participants, 
or only to counsel for parties or participants), and persons not 
specifically permitted access to the data will be excluded from the in 
camera part of the proceeding. The administrative law judge or other 
presiding officer may impose other conditions or safeguards. The limited 
availability of material under this paragraph does not constitute prior 
disclosure to the public as defined in Sec.  20.81, and no information 
subject to a particular order is to be submitted to or received or 
considered by FDA in support of a petition or other request from any 
other person.

Sec.  10.25  Initiation of administrative proceedings.

    An administrative proceeding may be initiated in the following three 
ways:
    (a) An interested person may petition the Commissioner to issue, 
amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or to take or refrain from 
taking any other form of administrative action. A petition must be 
either:
    (1) In the form specified in other applicable FDA regulations, e.g., 
the form for a color additive petition in Sec.  71.1, for a food 
additive petition in Sec.  171.1, for a new drug application in Sec.  
314.50, for a new animal drug application in Sec.  514.1, or
    (2) in the form for a citizen petition in Sec.  10.30.
    (b) The Commissioner may initiate a proceeding to issue, amend, or 
revoke a regulation or order or take or refrain from taking any other 
form of administrative action. FDA has primary jurisdiction to make the 
initial determination on issues within its statutory mandate, and will 
request a court to dismiss, or to hold in abeyance its determination of 
or refer to the agency for administrative determination, any issue which 
has not previously been determined by the agency or which, if it has 
previously been determined, the agency concluded should be reconsidered 
and subject to a new administrative determination. The Commissioner may 
utilize any of the procedures established in this part in reviewing and 
making a determination on any matter initiated under this paragraph.
    (c) The Commissioner will institute a proceeding to determine 
whether to issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order, or take or 
refrain from taking any other form of administrative action whenever any 
court, on its own initiative, holds in abeyance or refers any matter to 
the agency for an administrative determination and the Commissioner 
concludes that an administrative determination is feasible within agency 
priorities and resources.

Dockets Management with the date of filing and assigned a unique docket 
number. The unique docket number identifies the docket file established 
by the Division of Dockets Management for all submissions relating to

or in part. A request for alternative or different administrative action 
must be submitted as a separate petition.
    (e)(1) The Commissioner shall, in accordance with paragraph (e)(2), 
rule upon each petition filed under paragraph (c) of this section, 
taking into consideration (i) available agency resources for the 
category of subject matter, (ii) the priority assigned to the petition 
considering both the category of subject matter involved and the overall 
work of the agency, and (iii) time requirements established by statute.
    (2) Except as provided in paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the 
Commissioner shall furnish a response to each petitioner within 180 days 
of receipt of the petition. The response will either:
    (i) Approve the petition, in which case the Commissioner shall 
concurrently take appropriate action (e.g., publication of a Federal 
Register notice) implementing the approval;
    (ii) Deny the petition; or
    (iii) Provide a tentative response, indicating why the agency has 
been unable to reach a decision on the petition, e.g., because of the 
existence of other agency priorities, or a need for additional 
information. The tentative response may also indicate the likely 
ultimate agency response, and may specify when a final response may be 
furnished.
    (3) The Commissioner may grant or deny such a petition, in whole or 
in part, and may grant such other relief or take other action as the 
petition warrants. The petitioner is to be notified of the 
Commissioner's decision. The decision will be placed in the public 
docket file and may also be in the form of a notice published in the 
Federal Register.

Sec.  10.50 also apply.

without Agency approval and without prejudice to resubmission at any 
time until the Commissioner rules on the petition, unless the petition 
has been referred for a hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15 of this

[[Page 144]]

    (d) The Commissioner shall promptly review a petition for 
reconsideration. The Commissioner may grant the petition when the 
Commissioner determines it is in the public interest and in the interest 
of justice. The Commissioner shall grant a petition for reconsideration 
in any proceeding if the Commissioner determines all of the following 
apply:

only before the petitioner brings legal action in the courts to review 
the action, except that a petition may also be considered if the 
Commissioner has denied a petition for stay of action and the petitioner 
has petitioned for judicial review of the Commissioner's action and 
requested the reviewing court to grant a stay pending consideration of 
review. A petition for reconsideration submitted later than 30 days

taken. If review of the matter is pending in the courts, the 
Commissioner may request that the court refer the matter back to the 
agency or hold its review in abeyance pending administrative 
reconsideration. The administrative record of the proceeding is to 
include all additional documents relating to such reconsideration.
    (i) After determining to reconsider a matter, the Commissioner shall 
review and rule on the merits of the matter under Sec.  10.30(e). The

Sec.  10.40  Promulgation of regulations for the efficient enforcement
of the law.

    (a) The Commissioner may propose and promulgate regulations for the 
efficient enforcement of the laws administered by FDA whenever it is 
necessary or appropriate to do so. The issuance, amendment, or 
revocation of a regulation may be initiated in any of the ways specified 
in Sec.  10.25.
    (1) This section applies to any regulation: (i) Not subject to Sec.  
10.50 and part 12, or (ii) if it is subject to Sec.  10.50 and part 12, 
to the extent that those provisions make this section applicable.
    (2) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition 
submitted under Sec.  10.25(a) will be published in the Federal Register 
as a proposal if:
    (i) The petition contains facts demonstrating reasonable grounds for 
the proposal; and
    (ii) The petition substantially shows that the proposal is in the 
public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the 
agency.
    (3) Two or more alternative proposed regulations may be published on 
the same subject to obtain comment on the different alternatives.
    (4) A regulation proposed by an interested person in a petition 
submitted under Sec.  10.25(a) may be published together with the 
Commissioner's preliminary views on the proposal and any alternative 
proposal.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, each 
regulation must be the subject of a notice of proposed rulemaking 
published in the Federal Register. (1) The notice will contain:
    (i) The name of the agency;
    (ii) The nature of the action, e.g., proposed rule, or notice;
    (iii) A summary in the first paragraph describing the substance of 
the document in easily understandable terms;
    (iv) Relevant dates, e.g., comment closing date, and proposed 
effective date(s);
    (v) The name, business address, and phone number of an agency 
contact person who can provide further information to the public about 
the notice;
    (vi) An address for submitting written comments;
    (vii) Supplementary information about the notice in the form of a 
preamble that summarizes the proposal and the facts and policy 
underlying it, includes references to all information on which the 
Commissioner relies for the proposal (copies or a full list of which are 
a part of the docket file on the matter in the office of the Division of 
Dockets Management), and cites the authority under which the regulation 
is proposed;
    (viii) Either the terms or substance of the proposed regulation or a 
description of the subjects and issues involved;
    (ix) A reference to the existence or lack of need for an 
environmental impact statement under Sec.  25.52 of this chapter; and

[[Page 147]]

    (x) The docket number of the matter, which identifies the docket 
file established by the Division of Dockets Management for all relevant 
submissions.
    (2) The proposal will provide 60 days for comment, although the 
Commissioner may shorten or lengthen this time period for good cause. In 
no event is the time for comment to be less than 10 days.
    (3) After publication of the proposed rule, any interested person 
may request the Commissioner to extend the comment period for an 
additional specified period by submitting a written request to the 
Division of Dockets Management stating the grounds for the request. The 
request is submitted under Sec.  10.35 but should be headed ``REQUEST 
FOR EXTENSION OF COMMENT PERIOD.''
    (i) A request must discuss the reason comments could not feasibly be 
submitted within the time permitted, or that important new information 
will shortly be available, or that sound public policy otherwise 
supports an extension of the time for comment. The Commissioner may 
grant or deny the request or may grant an extension for a time period 
different from that requested. An extension may be limited to specific 
persons who have made and justified the request, but will ordinarily 
apply to all interested persons.
    (ii) A comment time extension of 30 days or longer will be published 
in the Federal Register and will be applicable to all interested 
persons. A comment time extension of less than 30 days will be the 
subject either of a letter or memorandum filed with the Division of 
Dockets Management or of a notice published in the Federal Register.
    (4) A notice of proposed rulemaking will request that four copies of 
all comments be submitted to the Division of Dockets Management, except 
that individuals may submit single copies. Comments will be stamped with 
the date of receipt and will be numbered chronologically.
    (5) Persons submitting comments critical of a proposed regulation 
are encouraged to include their preferred alternative wording.
    (c) After the time for comment on a proposed regulation has expired, 
the Commissioner will review the entire administrative record on the 
matter, including all comments and, in a notice published in the Federal 
Register, will terminate the proceeding, issue a new proposal, or 
promulgate a final regulation.
    (1) The quality and persuasiveness of the comments will be the basis 
for the Commissioner's decision. The number or length of comments will 
not ordinarily be a significant factor in the decision unless the number 
of comments is material where the degree of public interest is a 
legitimate factor for consideration.
    (2) The decision of the Commissioner on the matter will be based 
solely upon the administrative record.
    (3) A final regulation published in the Federal Register will have a 
preamble stating: (i) The name of the agency, (ii) the nature of the 
action e.g., final rule, notice, (iii) a summary first paragraph 
describing the substance of the document in easily understandable terms, 
(iv) relevant dates, e.g., the rule's effective date and comment closing 
date, if an opportunity for comment is provided, (v) the name, business 
address, and phone number of an agency contact person who can provide 
further information to the public about the notice, (vi) an address for 
the submission of written comments when they are permitted, (vii) 
supplementary information about the regulation in the body of the 
preamble that contains references to prior notices relating to the same 
matter and a summary of each type of comment submitted on the proposal 
and the Commissioner's conclusions with respect to each. The preamble is 
to contain a thorough and comprehensible explanation of the reasons for 
the Commissioner's decision on each issue.
    (4) The effective date of a final regulation may not be less than 30 
days after the date of publication in the Federal Register, except for:
    (i) A regulation that grants an exemption or relieves a restriction; 
or
    (ii) A regulation for which the Commissioner finds, and states in 
the notice good cause for an earlier effective date.
    (d) The provisions for notice and comment in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of

[[Page 148]]

this section apply only to the extent required by the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551, 552, and 553). As a matter of discretion, 
however, the Commissioner may voluntarily follow those provisions in 
circumstances in which they are not required by the Administrative 
Procedure Act.
    (e) The requirements of notice and public procedure in paragraph (b) 
of this section do not apply in the following situations:
    (1) When the Commissioner determines for good cause that they are 
impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. In these 
cases, the notice promulgating the regulation will state the reasons for 
the determination, and provide an opportunity for comment to determine 
whether the regulation should subsequently be modified or revoked. A 
subsequent notice based on those comments may, but need not, provide 
additional opportunity for public comment.
    (2) Food additive and color additive petitions, which are subject to 
the provisions of Sec.  12.20(b)(2).
    (3) New animal drug regulations, which are promulgated under section 
512(i) of the act.
    (f) In addition to the notice and public procedure required under 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may also subject a 
proposed or final regulation, before or after publication in the Federal 
Register, to the following additional procedures:
    (1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under 
Sec.  10.65.
    (2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, or 15.
    (3) A notice published in the Federal Register requesting 
information and views before the Commissioner determines whether to 
propose a regulation.
    (4) A draft of a proposed regulation placed on public display in the 
office of the Division of Dockets Management. If this procedure is used, 
the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in the Federal 
Register stating that the document is available and specifying the time 
within which comments on the draft proposal may be submitted orally or 
in writing.
    (5) A revised proposal published in the Federal Register, which 
proposal is subject to all the provisions in this section relating to 
proposed regulations.
    (6) A tentative final regulation or tentative revised final 
regulation placed on public display in the office of the Division of 
Dockets Management and, if deemed desirable by the Commissioner, 
published in the Federal Register. If the tentative regulation is placed 
on display only, the Commissioner shall publish an appropriate notice in 
the Federal Register stating that the document is available and 
specifying the time within which comments may be submitted orally or in 
writing on the tentative final regulation. The Commissioner shall mail a 
copy of the tentative final regulation and the Federal Register notice 
to each person who submitted comments on the proposed regulation if one 
has been published.
    (7) A final regulation published in the Federal Register that 
provides an opportunity for the submission of further comments, in 
accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
    (8) Any other public procedure established in this chapter and 
expressly applicable to the matter.
    (g) The record of the administrative proceeding consists of all of 
the following:
    (1) If the regulation was initiated by a petition, the 
administrative record specified in Sec.  10.30(i).
    (2) If a petition for reconsideration or for a stay of action is 
filed, the administrative record specified in Sec. Sec.  10.33(k) and 
10.35(h).
    (3) The proposed rule published in the Federal Register, including 
all information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the 
Division of Dockets Management on the proposal.
    (4) All comments received on the proposal, including all information 
submitted as a part of the comments.
    (5) The notice promulgating the final regulation, including all 
information identified or filed by the Commissioner with the Division of 
Dockets Management as part of the administrative record of the final 
regulation.
    (6) The transcripts, minutes of meetings, reports, Federal Register 
notices, and other documents resulting from the procedures specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section, but not the

[[Page 149]]

transcript of a closed portion of a public advisory committee meeting.
    (7) All documents submitted to the Division of Dockets Management 
under Sec.  10.65(h).
    (h) The record of the administrative proceeding closes on the date 
of publication of the final regulation in the Federal Register unless 
some other date is specified. Thereafter, any interested person may 
submit a petition for reconsideration under Sec.  10.33 or a petition 
for stay of action under Sec.  10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon 
information or views not included in the administrative record shall 
submit it to the Commissioner with a new petition to modify the final 
regulation.
    (i) The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a 
chronological list of all regulations proposed and promulgated under 
this section and Sec.  10.50 (which list will not include regulations 
resulting from petitions filed and assigned a docket number under Sec.  
10.30) showing--
    (1) The docket number (for a petition submitted directly to a 
center, the list also includes the number or other designation assigned 
by the center, e.g., the number assigned to a food additive petition);
    (2) The name of the petitioner, if any;
    (3) The subject matter involved; and
    (4) The disposition of the petition.

Sec.  10.45  Court review of final administrative action; exhaustion
of administrative remedies.

    (a) This section applies to court review of final administrative 
action taken by the Commissioner, including action taken under 
Sec. Sec.  10.25 through 10.40 and Sec.  16.1(b), except action subject 
to Sec.  10.50 and part 12.
    (b) A request that the Commissioner take or refrain from taking any 
form of administrative action must first be the subject of a final 
administrative decision based on a petition submitted under Sec.  
10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under Sec.  16.1(b) before any 
legal action is filed in a court complaining of the action or failure to 
act. If a court action is filed complaining of the action or failure to 
act before the submission of the decision on a petition under Sec.  
10.25(a) or, where applicable, a hearing under Sec.  16.1(b), the 
Commissioner shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to 
the agency for an initial administrative determination on the grounds of 
a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the lack of final agency 
action as required by 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., and the lack of an actual 
controversy as required by 28 U.S.C. 2201.
    (c) A request that administrative action be stayed must first be the 
subject of an administrative decision based upon a petition for stay of 
action submitted under Sec.  10.35 before a request is made that a court 
stay the action. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of 
administrative action before the Commissioner's decision on a petition 
submitted in a timely manner pursuant to Sec.  10.35, the Commissioner 
shall request dismissal of the court action or referral to the agency 
for an initial determination on the grounds of a failure to exhaust 
administrative remedies, the lack of final agency action as required by 
5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., and the lack of an actual controversy as required 
by 28 U.S.C. 2201. If a court action is filed requesting a stay of 
administrative action after a petition for a stay of action is denied 
because it was submitted after expiration of the time period provided 
under Sec.  10.35, or after the time for submitting such a petition has 
expired, the Commissioner will request dismissal of the court action on 
the ground of a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.
    (d) Unless otherwise provided, the Commissioner's final decision 
constitutes final agency action (reviewable in the courts under 5 U.S.C. 
701 et seq. and, where appropriate, 28 U.S.C. 2201) on a petition 
submitted under Sec.  10.25(a), on a petition for reconsideration 
submitted under Sec.  10.33, on a petition for stay of action submitted 
under Sec.  10.35, on an advisory opinion issued under Sec.  10.85, on a 
matter involving administrative action which is the subject of an 
opportunity for a hearing under Sec.  16.1(b) of this chapter, or on the 
issuance of a final regulation published in accordance with Sec.  10.40, 
except that

[[Page 150]]

the agency's response to a petition filed under section 505(j)(2)(C) of 
the act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(C)) and Sec.  314.93 of this chapter will 
not constitute final agency action until any petition for 
reconsideration submitted by the petitioner is acted on by the 
Commissioner.
    (1) It is the position of FDA except as otherwise provided in 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, that:
    (i) Final agency action exhausts all administrative remedies and is 
ripe for preenforcement judicial review as of the date of the final 
decision, unless applicable law explicitly requires that the petitioner 
take further action before judicial review is available;
    (ii) An interested person is affected by, and thus has standing to 
obtain judicial review of final agency action; and
    (iii) It is not appropriate to move to dismiss a suit for 
preenforcement judicial review of final agency action on the ground that 
indispenable parties are not joined or that it is an unconsented suit 
against the United States if the defect could be cured by amending the 
complaint.
    (2) The Commissioner shall object to judicial review of a matter if:
    (i) The matter is committed by law to the discretion of the 
Commissioner, e.g., a decision to recommend or not to recommend civil or 
criminal enforcement action under sections 302, 303, and 304 of the act; 
or
    (ii) Review is not sought in a proper court.
    (e) An interested person may request judicial review of a final 
decision of the Commissioner in the courts without first petitioning the 
Commissioner for reconsideration or for a stay of action, except that in 
accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, the person shall request 
a stay by the Commissioner under Sec.  10.35 before requesting a stay by 
the court.
    (f) The Commissioner shall take the position in an action for 
judicial review under 5 U.S.C. 701 et seq., whether or not it includes a 
request for a declaratory judgment under 28 U.S.C. 2201, or in any other 
case in which the validity of administrative action is properly 
challenged, that the validity of the action must be determined solely on 
the basis of the administrative record specified in Sec. Sec.  10.30(i), 
10.33(k), 10.35(h), 10.40(g), and 16.80(a) or the administrative record 
applicable to any decision or action under the regulations referenced in 
Sec.  16.1(b), and that additional information or views may not be 
considered. An interested person who wishes to rely upon information or 
views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to the 
Commissioner with a new petition to modify the action under Sec.  
10.25(a).
    (g) The Commissioner requests that all petitions for judicial review 
of a particular matter be filed in a single U.S. District court. If 
petitions are filed in more than one jurisdiction, the Commissioner will 
take appropriate action to prevent a multiplicity of suits in various 
jurisdictions, such as:
    (1) A request for transfer of one or more suits to consolidate 
separate actions, under 28 U.S.C. 1404(a) or 28 U.S.C. 2112(a);
    (2) A request that actions in all but one jurisdiction be stayed 
pending the conclusion of one proceeding;
    (3) A request that all but one action be dismissed pending the 
conclusion of one proceeding, with the suggestion that the other 
plaintiffs intervene in that one suit; or
    (4) A request that one of the suits be maintained as a class action 
in behalf of all affected persons.
    (h)(1) For the purpose of 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), a copy of any petition 
filed in any U.S. Court of Appeals challenging a final action of the 
Commissioner shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, 
or by personal delivery to the Chief Counsel of FDA. The petition copy 
shall be time-stamped by the clerk of the court when the original is 
filed with the court. The petition copy should be addressed to: Office 
of the Chief Counsel (GCF-1), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers 
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857. The Chief Counsel requests that the purpose 
of all petitions mailed or delivered to the Office of Chief Counsel to 
satisfy 28 U.S.C. 2112(a) be clearly identified in a cover letter.
    (2) If the Chief Counsel receives two or more petitions filed in two 
or more U.S. Courts of Appeals for review of any agency action within 10 
days of the

[[Page 151]]

effective date of that action for the purpose of judicial review, the 
Chief Counsel will notify the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict 
Litigation of any petitions that were received within the 10-day period, 
in accordance with the applicable rule of the panel.
    (3) For the purpose of determining whether a petition for review has 
been received within the 10-day period under paragraph (h)(2) of this 
section, the petition shall be considered to be received on the date of 
delivery, if personally delivered. If the delivery is accomplished by 
mail, the date of receipt shall be the date noted on the return receipt 
card.
    (i) Upon judicial review of administrative action under this 
section:
    (1) If a court determines that the administrative record is 
inadequate to support the action, the Commissioner shall determine 
whether to proceed with such action. (i) If the Commissioner decides to 
proceed with the action, the court will be requested to remand the 
matter to the agency to reopen the administrative proceeding and record, 
or on the Commissioner's own initiative the administrative proceeding 
and record may be reopened upon receipt of the court determination. A 
reopened administrative proceeding will be conducted under the 
provisions of this part and in accordance with any directions of the 
court.
    (ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires 
that the action remain in effect pending further administrative 
proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the 
interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further administrative 
proceedings.
    (2) If a court determines that the administrative record is 
adequate, but the rationale for the action must be further explained:
    (i) The Commissioner shall request either that further explanation 
be provided in writing directly to the court without further 
administrative proceedings, or that the administrative proceeding be 
reopened in accordance with paragraph (i)(1)(i) of this section; and
    (ii) If the Commissioner concludes that the public interest requires 
that the action remain in effect pending further court or administrative 
proceedings, the court will be requested not to stay the matter in the 
interim and the Commissioner shall expedite the further proceedings.

Sec.  10.55  Separation of functions; ex parte communications.

    (a) This section applies to any matter subject by statute to an 
opportunity for a formal evidentiary public hearing, as listed in Sec.  
10.50(c), and any matter subject to a hearing before a Public Board of 
Inquiry under part 13.
    (b) In the case of a matter listed in Sec.  10.50(c) (1) through 
(10) and (12) through (15):
    (1) An interested person may meet or correspond with any FDA 
representative concerning a matter prior to publication of a notice 
announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing or a hearing before a 
Public Board of Inquiry on the matter; the provisions of Sec.  10.65 
apply to the meetings and correspondence; and
    (2) Upon publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary 
public hearing or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry, the 
following separation of functions apply:
    (i) The center responsible for the matter is, as a party to the 
hearing, responsible for all investigative functions and for 
presentation of the position of the center at the hearing and in any 
pleading or oral argument before the Commissioner. Representatives of 
the center may not participate or advise in any decision except as 
witness or counsel in public proceedings. There is to be no other 
communication between representatives of the center and representatives 
of the office of the Commissioner concerning the matter before the 
decision of the Commissioner. The Commissioner may, however, designate 
representatives of a center to advise the office of the Commissioner, or 
designate members of that office to advise a center. The designation 
will be in writing and filed with the Division of Dockets Management no 
later than the time specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for 
the application of separation of functions. All members of FDA other 
than representatives of the involved center (except those specifically 
designated otherwise) shall be available to advise and participate with 
the office of the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing 
and the final decision.
    (ii) The Chief Counsel for FDA shall designate members of the office 
of General Counsel to advise and participate with the center in its 
functions in the hearing and members who are to advise the office of the 
Commissioner in its functions related to the hearing and the final 
decision. The members of the office of General Counsel designated to 
advise the center may not participate or advise in any decision of the 
Commissioner except as counsel in public proceedings. The designation is 
to be in the form of a memorandum filed with the Division of Dockets 
Management and made a part of the administrative record in the 
proceeding. There may be

[[Page 153]]

no other communication between those members of the office of General 
Counsel designated to advise the office of the Commissioner and any 
other persons in the office of General Counsel or in the involved center 
with respect to the matter prior to the decision of the Commissioner. 
The Chief Counsel may assign new attorneys to advise either the center 
or the office of the Commissioner at any stage of the proceedings. The 
Chief Counsel will ordinarily advise and participate with the office of 
the Commissioner in its functions relating to the hearing and the final 
decision.
    (iii) The office of the Commissioner is responsible for the agency 
review and final decision of the matter, with the advice and 
participation of anyone in FDA other than representatives of the 
involved center and those members of the office of General Counsel 
designated to assist in the center's functions in the hearing.
    (c) In a matter listed in Sec.  10.50(c) (11) and (16) through (19), 
the provisions relating to separation of functions set forth in 
Sec. Sec.  314.200(f), 514.200, and 601.7(a) are applicable before 
publication of a notice announcing a formal evidentiary public hearing 
or a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry. Following publication of 
the notice of hearing, the rules in paragraph (b)(2) of this section 
apply.
    (d) Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, between the 
date that separation of functions applies under paragraph (b) or (c) of 
this section and the date of the Commissioner's decision on the matter, 
communication concerning the matter involved in the hearing will be 
restricted as follows:
    (1) No person outside the agency may have an ex parte communication 
with the presiding officer or any person representing the office of the 
Commissioner concerning the matter in the hearing. Neither the presiding 
officer nor any person representing the office of the Commissioner may 
have any ex parte communication with a person outside the agency 
concerning the matter in the hearing. All communications are to be 
public communications, as witness or counsel, under the applicable 
provisions of this part.
    (2) A participant in the hearing may submit a written communication 
to the office of the Commissioner with respect to a proposal for 
settlement. These communications are to be in the form of pleadings, 
served on all other participants, and filed with the Division of Dockets 
Management like any other pleading.
    (3) A written communication contrary to this section must be 
immediately served on all other participants and filed with the Division 
of Dockets Management by the presiding officer at the hearing, or by the 
Commissioner, depending on who received the communication. An oral 
communication contrary to this section must be immediately recorded in a 
written memorandum and similarly served on all other participants and 
filed with the Division of Dockets Management. A person, including a 
representative of a participant in the hearing, who is involved in an 
oral communication contrary to this section, must, if possible, be made 
available for cross-examination during the hearing with respect to the 
substance of that conversation. Rebuttal testimony pertinent to a 
written or oral communication contrary to this section will be 
permitted. Cross-examination and rebuttal testimony will be transcribed 
and filed with the Division of Dockets Management.
    (e) The prohibitions specified in paragraph (d) of this section 
apply to a person who knows of a notice of hearing in advance of its 
publication from the time the knowledge is acquired.
    (f) The making of a communication contrary to this section may, 
consistent with the interests of justice and the policy of the 
underlying statute, result in a decision adverse to the person knowingly 
making or causing the making of such a communication.

Sec.  10.60  Referral by court.

    (a) This section applies when a Federal, State, or local court holds 
in abeyance, or refers to the Commissioner, any matter for an initial 
administrative determination under Sec.  10.25(c) or Sec.  10.45(b).

[[Page 154]]

    (b) The Commissioner shall promptly agree or decline to accept a 
court referral. Whenever feasible in light of agency priorities and 
resources, the Commissioner shall agree to accept a referral and shall 
proceed to determine the matter referred.
    (c) In reviewing the matter, the Commissioner may use the following 
procedures:
    (1) Conferences, meetings, discussions, and correspondence under 
Sec.  10.65.
    (2) A hearing under parts 12, 13, 14, 15, or 16.
    (3) A notice published in the Federal Register requesting 
information and views.
    (4) Any other public procedure established in other sections of this 
chapter and expressly applicable to the matter under those provisions.
    (d) If the Commissioner's review of the matter results in a proposed 
rule, the provisions of Sec.  10.40 or Sec.  10.50 also apply.



Sec.  10.65  Meetings and correspondence.

    (a) In addition to public hearings and proceedings established under 
this part and other sections of this chapter, meetings may be held and 
correspondence may be exchanged between representatives of FDA and an 
interested person outside FDA on a matter within the jurisdiction of the 
laws administered by the Commissioner. Action on meetings and 
correspondence does not constitute final administrative action subject 
to judicial review under Sec.  10.45.
    (b) The Commissioner may conclude that it would be in the public 
interest to hold an open public meeting to discuss a matter (or class of 
matters) pending before FDA, in which any interested person may 
participate.
    (1) The Commissioner shall inform the public of the time and place 
of the meeting and of the matters to be discussed.
    (2) The meeting will be informal, i.e., any interested person may 
attend and participate in the discussion without prior notice to the 
agency unless the notice of the meeting specifies otherwise.
    (c) Every person outside the Federal Government may request a 
private meeting with a representative of FDA in agency offices to 
discuss a matter. FDA will make reasonable efforts to accommodate such 
requests.
    (1) The person requesting a meeting may be accompanied by a 
reasonable number of employees, consultants, or other persons with whom 
there is a commercial arrangement within the meaning of Sec.  20.81(a) 
of this chapter. Neither FDA nor any other person may require the 
attendance of a person who is not an employee of the executive branch of 
the Federal Government without the agreement of the person requesting 
the meeting. Any person may attend by mutual consent of the person 
requesting the meeting and FDA.
    (2) FDA will determine which representatives of the agency will 
attend the meeting. The person requesting the meeting may request, but 
not require or preclude, the attendance of a specific FDA employee.
    (3) A person who wishes to attend a private meeting, but who is not 
invited to attend either by the person requesting the meeting or by FDA, 
or who otherwise cannot attend the meeting, may request a separate 
meeting with FDA to discuss the same matter or an additional matter.
    (d) FDA employees have a responsibility to meet with all segments of 
the public to promote the objectives of the laws administered by the 
agency. In pursuing this responsibility, the following general policy 
applies where agency employees are invited by persons outside the 
Federal Government to attend or participate in meetings outside agency 
offices as representatives of the agency.
    (1) A person outside the executive branch may invite an agency 
representative to attend or participate in a meeting outside agency 
offices. The agency representative is not obligated to attend or 
participate, but may do so where it is in the public interest and will 
promote the objectives of the act.
    (2) The agency representative may request that the meeting be open 
if that would be in the public interest. The agency representative may 
decline to participate in a meeting held as a private meeting if that 
will best serve the public interest.
    (3) An agency representative may not knowingly participate in a 
meeting

[[Page 155]]

that is closed on the basis of gender, race, or religion.
    (e) An official transcript, recording, or memorandum summarizing the 
substance of any meeting described in this section will be prepared by a 
representative of FDA when the agency determines that such documentation 
will be useful.
    (f) FDA promptly will file in the appropriate administrative file 
memoranda of meetings prepared by FDA representatives and all 
correspondence, including any written summary of a meeting from a 
participant, that relate to a matter pending before the agency.
    (g) Representatives of FDA may initiate a meeting or correspondence 
on any matter concerning the laws administered by the Commissioner. 
Unless otherwise required by law, meetings may be public or private at 
FDA's discretion.
    (h) A meeting of an advisory committee is subject to the 
requirements of part 14 of this chapter.

[66 FR 6468, Jan. 22, 2001]



Sec.  10.70  Documentation of significant decisions in administrative file.

    (a) This section applies to every significant FDA decision on any 
matter under the laws administered by the Commissioner, whether it is 
raised formally, for example, by a petition or informally, for example, 
by correspondence.
    (b) FDA employees responsible for handling a matter are responsible 
for insuring the completeness of the administrative file relating to it. 
The file must contain:
    (1) Appropriate documentation of the basis for the decision, 
including relevant evaluations, reviews, memoranda, letters, opinions of 
consultants, minutes of meetings, and other pertinent written documents; 
and
    (2) The recommendations and decisions of individual employees, 
including supervisory personnel, responsible for handling the matter.
    (i) The recommendations and decisions are to reveal significant 
controversies or differences of opinion and their resolution.
    (ii) An agency employee working on a matter and, consistent with the 
prompt completion of other assignments, an agency employee who has 
worked on a matter may record individual views on that matter in a 
written memorandum, which is to be placed in the file.
    (c) A written document placed in an administrative file must:
    (1) Relate to the factual, scientific, legal or related issues under 
consideration;
    (2) Be dated and signed by the author;
    (3) Be directed to the file, to appropriate supervisory personnel, 
and to other appropriate employees, and show all persons to whom copies 
were sent;
    (4) Avoid defamatory language, intemperate remarks, undocumented 
charges, or irrelevant matters (e.g., personnel complaints);
    (5) If it records the views, analyses, recommendations, or decisions 
of an agency employee in addition to the author, be given to the other 
employees; and
    (6) Once completed (i.e., typed in final form, dated, and signed) 
not be altered or removed. Later additions to or revisions of the 
document must be made in a new document.
    (d) Memoranda or other documents that are prepared by agency 
employees and are not in the administrative file have no status or 
effect.
    (e) FDA employees working on a matter have access to the 
administrative file on that matter, as appropriate for the conduct of 
their work. FDA employees who have worked on a matter have access to the 
administrative file on that matter so long as attention to their 
assignments is not impeded. Reasonable restrictions may be placed upon 
access to assure proper cataloging and storage of documents, the 
availability of the file to others, and the completeness of the file for 
review.



Sec.  10.75  Internal agency review of decisions.

    (a) A decision of an FDA employee, other than the Commissioner, on a 
matter, is subject to review by the employee's supervisor under the 
following circumstances:
    (1) At the request of the employee.
    (2) On the initiative of the supervisor.

[[Page 156]]

    (3) At the request of an interested person outside the agency.
    (4) As required by delegations of authority.
    (b)(1) The review will be made by consultation between the employee 
and the supervisor or by review of the administrative file on the 
matter, or both. The review will ordinarily follow the established 
agency channels of supervision or review for that matter.
    (2) A sponsor, applicant, or manufacturer of a drug or device 
regulated under the act or the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 
262), may request review of a scientific controversy by an appropriate 
scientific advisory panel as described in section 505(n) of the act, or 
an advisory committee as described in section 515(g)(2)(B) of the act. 
The reason(s) for any denial of a request for such review shall be 
briefly set forth in writing to the requester. Persons who receive a 
Center denial of their request under this section may submit a request 
for review of the denial. The request should be sent to the Chief 
Mediator and Ombudsman.
    (c) An interested person outside the agency may request internal 
agency review of a decision through the established agency channels of 
supervision or review. Personal review of these matters by center 
directors or the office of the Commissioner will occur for any of the 
following purposes:
    (1) To resolve an issue that cannot be resolved at lower levels 
within the agency (e.g., between two parts of a center or other 
component of the agency, between two centers or other components of the 
agency, or between the agency and an interested person outside the 
agency).
    (2) To review policy matters requiring the attention of center or 
agency management.
    (3) In unusual situations requiring an immediate review in the 
public interest.
    (4) As required by delegations of authority.
    (d) Internal agency review of a decision must be based on the 
information in the administrative file. If an interested person presents 
new information not in the file, the matter will be returned to the 
appropriate lower level in the agency for reevaluation based on the new 
information.

Sec.  10.80  Dissemination of draft Federal Register notices and 
regulations.

    (a) A representative of FDA may discuss orally or in writing with an 
interested person ideas and recommendations for notices or regulations. 
FDA welcomes assistance in developing ideas for, and in gathering the 
information to support, notices and regulations.
    (b) Notices and proposed regulations. (1) Once it is determined that 
a notice or proposed regulation will be prepared, the general concepts 
may be discussed by a representative of FDA with an interested person. 
Details of a draft of a notice or proposed regulation may be discussed 
with a person outside the executive branch only with the specific 
permission of the Commissioner. The permission must be in writing and 
filed with the Division of Dockets Management.
    (2) A draft of a notice or proposed regulation or its preamble, or a 
portion of either, may be furnished to an interested person outside the 
executive branch only if it is made available to all interested persons 
by a notice published in the Federal Register. A draft of a notice or 
proposed regulation made available in this manner may, without the prior 
permission of the Commissioner, be discussed with an interested person 
to clarify and resolve questions raised and concerns expressed about the 
draft.
    (c) After publication of a notice or proposed regulation in the 
Federal Register, and before preparation of a draft of the final notice 
or regulation, a representative of FDA may discuss the proposal with an 
interested person as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (d) Final notices and regulations. (1) Details of a draft of a final 
notice or regulation may be discussed with an interested person outside 
the executive branch only with the specific permission of the 
Commissioner. The permission must be in writing and filed with the 
Division of Dockets Management.

[[Page 157]]

    (2) A draft of a final notice or regulation or its preamble, or any 
portion of either, may be furnished to an interested person outside the 
executive branch only if it is made available to all interested persons 
by a notice published in the Federal Register, except as otherwise 
provided in paragraphs (g) and (j) of this section. A draft of a final 
notice or regulation made available to an interested person in this 
manner may, without the prior permission of the Commissioner, be 
discussed as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.
    (i) The final notice or regulation and its preamble will be prepared 
solely on the basis of the administrative record.
    (ii) If additional technical information from a person outside the 
executive branch is necessary to draft the final notice or regulation or 
its preamble, it will be requested by FDA in general terms and furnished 
directly to the Division of Dockets Management to be included as part of 
the administrative record.
    (iii) If direct discussion by FDA of a draft of a final notice or 
regulation or its preamble is required with a person outside the 
executive branch, appropriate protective procedures will be undertaken 
to make certain that a full and impartial administrative record is 
established. Such procedures may include either:
    (a) The scheduling of an open public meeting under Sec.  10.65(b) at 
which interested persons may participate in review of and comment on the 
draft document; or
    (b) The preparation of a tentative final regulation or tentative 
revised final regulation under Sec.  10.40(f)(6), on which interested 
persons will be given an additional period of time for oral and written 
comment.
    (e) After a final regulation is published, an FDA representative may 
discuss any aspect of it with an interested person.
    (f) In addition to the requirements of this section, the provisions 
of Sec.  10.55 apply to the promulgation of a regulation subject to 
Sec.  10.50 and part 12.
    (g) A draft of a final food additive color additive, or new animal 
drug regulation may be furnished to the petitioner for comment on the 
technical accuracy of the regulation. Every meeting with a petitioner 
relating to the draft will be recorded in a written memorandum, and all 
memoranda and correspondence will be filed with the Division of Dockets 
Management as part of the administrative record of the regulation under 
the provisions of Sec.  10.65.
    (h) In accordance with 42 U.S.C 263f, the Commissioner shall consult 
with interested persons and with the Technical Electronic Product 
Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) before prescribing any 
performance standard for an electronic product. Accordingly, the 
Commissioner shall publish in the Federal Register an announcement when 
a proposed or final performance standard, including any amendment, is 
being considered for an electronic product, and any draft of any 
proposed or final standard will be furnished to an interested person 
upon request and may be discussed in detail.
    (i) The provisions of Sec.  10.65 apply to meetings and 
correspondence relating to draft notices and regulations.
    (j) The provisions of this section restricting discussion and 
disclosure of draft notices and regulations do not apply to situations 
covered by Sec. Sec.  20.83 through 20.89.

Sec.  10.85  Advisory opinions.

    (a) An interested person may request an advisory opinion from the 
Commissioner on a matter of general applicability.
    (1) The request will be granted whenever feasible.
    (2) The request may be denied if:
    (i) The request contains incomplete information on which to base an 
informed advisory opinion;
    (ii) The Commissioner concludes that an advisory opinion cannot 
reasonably be given on the matter involved;
    (iii) The matter is adequately covered by a prior advisory opinion 
or a regulation;
    (iv) The request covers a particular product or ingredient or label 
and does not raise a policy issue of broad applicability; or

[[Page 158]]

    (v) The Commissioner otherwise concludes that an advisory opinion 
would not be in the public interest.
    (b) A request for an advisory opinion is to be submitted in 
accordance with Sec.  10.20, is subject to the provisions of Sec.  10.30 
(c) through (l), and must be in the following form:

(Date)__________________________________________________________________

    Division of Dockets Management, Food and Drug Administration, 
Department of Health and Human Services, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, 
Rockville, MD 20852.

                      Request for Advisory Opinion

    The undersigned submits this request for an advisory opinion of the 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs with respect to ------ (the general 
nature of the matter involved).
    A. Issues involved.
    (A concise statement of the issues and questions on which an opinion 
is requested.)
    B. Statement of facts and law.
    (A full statement of all facts and legal points relevant to the 
request.)
    The undersigned certifies that, to the best of his/her knowledge and 
belief, this request includes all data, information, and views relevant 
to the matter, whether favorable or unfavorable to the position of the 
undersigned, which is the subject of the request.

(Signature)_____________________________________________________________
(Person making request)_________________________________________________
(Mailing address)_______________________________________________________
(Telephone number)______________________________________________________

    (c) The Commissioner may respond to an oral or written request to 
the agency as a request for an advisory opinion, in which case the 
request will be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and be 
subject to this section.
    (d) A statement of policy or interpretation made in the following 
documents, unless subsequently repudiated by the agency or overruled by 
a court, will constitute an advisory opinion:
    (1) Any portion of a Federal Register notice other than the text of 
a proposed or final regulation, e.g., a notice to manufacturers or a 
preamble to a proposed or final regulation.
    (2) Trade Correspondence (T.C. Nos. 1-431 and 1A-8A) issued by FDA 
between 1938 and 1946.
    (3) Compliance policy guides issued by FDA beginning in 1968 and 
codified in the Compliance Policy Guides manual.
    (4) Other documents specifically identified as advisory opinions, 
e.g., advisory opinions on the performance standard for diagnostic X-ray 
systems, issued before July 1, 1975, and filed in a permanent public 
file for prior advisory opinions maintained by the Division of Freedom 
of Information (ELEM-1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the Freedom of 
Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at 
http://www.fda.gov.)
    (e) An advisory opinion represents the formal position of FDA on a 
matter and except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, 
obligates the agency to follow it until it is amended or revoked. The 
Commissioner may not recommend legal action against a person or product 
with respect to an action taken in conformity with an advisory opinion 
which has not been amended or revoked.
    (f) In unusual situations involving an immediate and significant 
danger to health, the Commissioner may take appropriate civil 
enforcement action contrary to an advisory opinion before amending or 
revoking the opinion. This action may be taken only with the approval of 
the Commissioner, who may not delegate this function. Appropriate 
amendment or revocation of the advisory opinion involved will be 
expedited.
    (g) An advisory opinion may be amended or revoked at any time after 
it has been issued. Notice of amendment or revocation will be given in 
the same manner as notice of the advisory opinion was originally given 
or in the Federal Register, and will be placed on public display as part 
of the file on the matter in the office of the Division of Dockets 
Management. The Division of Dockets Management shall maintain a separate 
chronological index of all advisory opinions filed. The index will 
specify the date of the request for the advisory opinion, the date of 
the opinion, and identification of the appropriate file.
    (h) Action undertaken or completed in conformity with an advisory 
opinion which has subsequently been amended or revoked is acceptable to 
FDA unless the Commissioner determines that substantial public interest 
considerations preclude continued acceptance. Whenever possible, an 
amended or revoked advisory opinion will state when action previously 
undertaken or completed

[[Page 159]]

does not remain acceptable, and any transition period that may be 
applicable.
    (i) An interested person may submit written comments on an advisory 
opinion or modified advisory opinion. Four copies of any comments are to 
be sent to the Division of Dockets Management for inclusion in the 
public file on the advisory opinion. Individuals may submit only one 
copy. Comments will be considered in determining whether further 
modification of an advisory opinion is warranted.
    (j) An advisory opinion may be used in administrative or court 
proceedings to illustrate acceptable and unacceptable procedures or 
standards, but not as a legal requirement.
    (k) A statement made or advice provided by an FDA employee 
constitutes an advisory opinion only if it is issued in writing under 
this section. A statement or advice given by an FDA employee orally, or 
given in writing but not under this section or Sec.  10.90, is an 
informal communication that represents the best judgment of that 
employee at that time but does not constitute an advisory opinion, does 
not necessarily represent the formal position of FDA, and does not bind 
or otherwise obligate or commit the agency to the views expressed.

Sec.  10.90  Food and Drug Administration regulations, recommendations,
and agreements.

    (a) Regulations. FDA regulations are issued in the Federal Register 
under Sec.  10.40 or Sec.  10.50 and codified in the Code of Federal 
Regulations. Regulations may contain provisions that will be enforced as 
legal requirements, or which are intended only as guidance documents and 
recommendations, or both. The dissemination of draft notices and 
regulations is subject to Sec.  10.80.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) Recommendations. In addition to the guidance documents subject 
to Sec.  10.115, FDA often formulates and disseminates recommendations 
about matters which are authorized by, but do not involve direct 
regulatory action under, the laws administered by the Commissioner, 
e.g., model State and local ordinances, or personnel practices for 
reducing radiation exposure, issued under 42 U.S.C. 243 and 21 U.S.C. 
360ii. These recommendations may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, 
be handled under the procedures established in Sec.  10.115, except that 
the recommendations will be included in a separate public file of 
recommendations established by the Division of Dockets Management and 
will be separated from the guidance documents in the notice of 
availability published in the Federal Register, or be published in the 
Federal Register as regulations under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (d) Agreements. Formal agreements, memoranda of understanding, or 
other similar written documents executed by FDA and another person will 
be included in the public file on agreements established by the Division 
of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the 
Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on the agency's web 
site at http://www.fda.gov) under Sec.  20.108. A document not included 
in the public file is deemed to be rescinded and has no force or effect 
whatever.

Sec.  10.95  Participation in outside standard-setting activities.

    (a) General. This section applies to participation by FDA employees 
in standard-setting activities outside the agency. Standard-setting 
activities include matters such as the development of performance 
characteristics, testing methodology, manufacturing practices, product 
standards, scientific protocols, compliance criteria, ingredient 
specifications, labeling, or other technical or policy criteria. FDA 
encourages employee participation in outside standard-setting activities 
that are in the public interest.
    (b) Standard-setting activities by other Federal Government 
agencies. (1) An FDA employee may participate in these activities after 
approval of the activity

[[Page 160]]

under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual Guide.
    (2) Approval forms and all pertinent background information 
describing the activity will be included in the public file on standard-
setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information 
(ELEM-1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the Freedom of Information 
Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at http://
www.fda.gov).
    (3) If a member of the public is invited by FDA to present views to, 
or to accompany, the FDA employee at a meeting, the invitations will be 
extended to a representative sampling of the public, including consumer 
groups, industry associations, professional societies, and academic 
institutions.
    (4) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an 
activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation 
in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the 
activity.
    (c) Standard-setting activities by State and local government 
agencies and by United Nations organizations and other international 
organizations and foreign governments pursuant to treaty. (1) An FDA 
employee may participate in these activities after approval of the 
activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual 
Guide.
    (2) Approval forms and all pertinent background information 
describing the activity will be included in the public file on standard-
setting activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information 
(ELEM-1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the Freedom of Information 
Staff's address is available on the agency's web site at http://
www.fda.gov).
    (3) The availability for public disclosure of records relating to 
the activity will be governed by part 20.
    (4) If a member of the public is invited by FDA to present views to, 
or to accompany, the FDA employee at a meeting, the invitation will be 
extended to a representative sampling of the public, including consumer 
groups, industry associations, professional societies, and academic 
institutions.
    (5) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an 
activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation 
in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the 
activity.
    (d) Standard-setting activities by private groups and organizations. 
(1) An FDA employee may engage in these activities after approval of the 
activity under procedures specified in the current agency Staff Manual 
Guide. A request for official participation must be made by the group or 
organization in writing, must describe the scope of the activity, and 
must demonstrate that the minimum standards set out in paragraph (d)(5) 
of this section are met. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section, a request that is granted will be the subject of a letter from 
the Commissioner or the center director to the organization stating--
    (i) Whether participation by the individual will be as a voting or 
nonvoting liaison representative;
    (ii) That participation by the individual does not connote FDA 
agreement with, or endorsement of, any decisions reached; and
    (iii) That participation by the individual precludes service as the 
deciding official on the standard involved if it should later come 
before FDA. The deciding official is the person who signs a document 
ruling upon the standard.
    (2) The letter requesting official FDA participation, the approval 
form, and the Commissioner's or center director's letter, together with 
all pertinent background information describing the activities involved, 
will be included in the public file on standard-setting activities 
established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)'' and 
adding in its place ``(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is 
available on the agency's web site at http://www.fda.gov).
    (3) The availability for public disclosure of records relating to 
the activities will be governed by part 20.
    (4) An FDA employee appointed as the liaison representative to an 
activity shall refer all requests for information about or participation 
in the activity to the group or organization responsible for the 
activity.
    (5) The following minimum standards apply to an outside private 
standard-

[[Page 161]]

setting activity in which FDA employees participate:
    (i) The activity will be based upon consideration of sound 
scientific and technological information, will permit revision on the 
basis of new information, and will be designed to protect the public 
against unsafe, ineffective, or deceptive products or practices.
    (ii) The activity and resulting standards will not be designed for 
the economic benefit of any company, group, or organization, will not be 
used for such antitrust violations as fixing prices or hindering 
competition, and will not involve establishment of certification or 
specific approval of individual products or services.
    (iii) The group or organization responsible for the standard-setting 
activity must have a procedure by which an interested person will have 
an opportunity to provide information and views on the activity and 
standards involved, without the payment of fees, and the information and 
views will be considered. How this is accomplished, including whether 
the presentation will be in person or in writing, will be decided by the 
group or organization responsible for the activity.
    (6) Membership of an FDA employee in an organization that also 
conducts a standard-setting activity does not invoke the provisions of 
this section unless the employee participates in the standard-setting 
activity. Participation in a standard-setting activity is subject to 
this section.
    (7) The Commissioner may determine in writing that, because direct 
involvement by FDA in a particular standard-setting activity is in the 
public interest and will promote the objectives of the act and the 
agency, the participation is exempt from the requirements of paragraph 
(d)(1) (ii) and/or (iii) of this section. This determination will be 
included in the public file on standard-setting activities established 
by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-1029)'' and adding in 
its place ``(the Freedom of Information Staff's address is available on 
the agency's web site at http://www.fda.gov) and in any relevant 
administrative file. The activity may include the establishment and 
validation of analytical methods for regulatory use, drafting uniform 
laws and regulations, and the development of recommendations concerning 
public health and preventive medicine practices by national and 
international organizations.
    (8) Because of the close daily cooperation between FDA and the 
associations of State and local government officials listed below in 
this paragraph, and the large number of agency employees who are members 
of or work with these associations, participation in the activities of 
these associations is exempt from paragraphs (d)(1) through (7) of this 
section, except that a list of the committees and other groups of these 
associations will be included in the public file on standard-setting 
activities established by the Division of Freedom of Information (ELEM-
1029)'' and adding in its place ``(the Freedom of Information Staff's

Sec.  10.100  Public calendar.

    (a) Public calendar. A public calendar will be prepared and made 
publicly available by FDA each week showing, to the extent feasible, 
significant events of the previous week, including significant meetings 
with persons outside the executive branch, that involve the 
representatives of FDA designated under paragraph (c) of this section.
    (1) Public calendar entries will include:
    (i) Significant meetings with members of the judiciary, 
representatives of Congress, or staffs of congressional committees when 
the meeting relates to a pending court case, administrative hearing, or 
other regulatory action or decision;
    (ii) Significant meetings, conferences, seminars, and speeches; and
    (iii) Social events sponsored by the regulated industry.
    (2) The public calendar will not include reports of meetings that 
would prejudice law enforcement activities (e.g., a meeting with an 
informant) or invade privacy (e.g., a meeting with a candidate for 
possible employment at FDA), meetings with members of the press, or 
meetings with onsite contractors.
    (b) Calendar entries. The calendar will specify for each entry the 
date, person(s), and subject matter involved. If a large number of 
persons are in attendance, the name of each individual need not be 
specified. When more than one FDA representative is in attendance, the 
most senior agency official will report the meeting on the public 
calendar.
    (c) Affected persons. The following FDA representatives are subject 
to the requirements of this section:
    (1) Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (2) Senior Associate Commissioners.
    (3) Deputy Commissioners.
    (4) Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
    (5) Center Directors.
    (6) Chief Counsel for the Food and Drug Administration.
    (d) Public display. The public calendar will be placed on public 
display at the following locations:
    (1) Division of Dockets Management.
    (2) Office of the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.
    (3) The FDA home page, to the extent feasible.

[66 FR 6468, Jan. 22, 2001]



Sec.  10.105  Representation by an organization.

    (a) An organization may represent its members by filing petitions, 
comments, and objections, and otherwise participating in an 
administrative proceeding subject to this part.
    (b) A petition, comment, objection, or other representation by an 
organization will not abridge the right of a member to take individual 
action of a similar type, in the member's own name.
    (c) It is requested that each organization participating in FDA 
administrative proceedings file annually with the Division of Dockets 
Management a current list of all of the members of the organization.
    (d) The filing by an organization of an objection or request for 
hearing under Sec. Sec.  12.20 through 12.22 does not provide a member a 
legal right with respect to the objection or request for hearing that 
the member may individually exercise. A member of an organization 
wishing to file an objection or request for hearing must do so 
individually.
    (e) In a court proceeding in which an organization participates, the 
Commissioner will take appropriate legal measures to have the case 
brought or considered as a class action or otherwise as binding upon all 
members of the organization except those specifically excluded by name. 
Regardless of whether the case is brought or considered as a class 
action or as otherwise binding upon all members of the organization 
except those specifically excluded by name, the Commissioner will take 
the position in any subsequent suit involving the same issues and a 
member of the organization that the

[[Page 163]]

issues are precluded from further litigation by the member under the 
doctrines of collateral estoppel or res judicata.



Sec.  10.110  Settlement proposals.

    At any time in the course of a proceeding subject to this part, a 
person may propose settlement of the issues involved. A participant in a 
proceeding will have an opportunity to consider a proposed settlement. 
Unaccepted proposals of settlement and related matters, e.g., proposed 
stipulations not agreed to, will not be admissible in evidence in an FDA 
administrative proceeding. FDA will oppose the admission in evidence of 
settlement information in a court proceeding or in another 
administrative proceeding.



Sec.  10.115  Good guidance practices.

    (a) What are good guidance practices? Good guidance practices 
(GGP's) are FDA's policies and procedures for developing, issuing, and 
using guidance documents.
    (b) What is a guidance document? (1) Guidance documents are 
documents prepared for FDA staff, applicants/sponsors, and the public 
that describe the agency's interpretation of or policy on a regulatory 
issue.
    (2) Guidance documents include, but are not limited to, documents 
that relate to: The design, production, labeling, promotion, 
manufacturing, and testing of regulated products; the processing, 
content, and evaluation or approval of submissions; and inspection and 
enforcement policies.
    (3) Guidance documents do not include: Documents relating to 
internal FDA procedures, agency reports, general information documents 
provided to consumers or health professionals, speeches, journal 
articles and editorials, media interviews, press materials, warning 
letters, memoranda of understanding, or other communications directed to 
individual persons or firms.
    (c) What other terms have a special meaning? (1) ``Level 1 guidance 
documents'' include guidance documents that:
    (i) Set forth initial interpretations of statutory or regulatory 
requirements;
    (ii) Set forth changes in interpretation or policy that are of more 
than a minor nature;
    (iii) Include complex scientific issues; or
    (iv) Cover highly controversial issues.
    (2) ``Level 2 guidance documents'' are guidance documents that set 
forth existing practices or minor changes in interpretation or policy. 
Level 2 guidance documents include all guidance documents that are not 
classified as Level 1.
    (3) ``You'' refers to all affected parties outside of FDA.
    (d) Are you or FDA required to follow a guidance document? (1) No. 
Guidance documents do not establish legally enforceable rights or 
responsibilities. They do not legally bind the public or FDA.
    (2) You may choose to use an approach other than the one set forth 
in a guidance document. However, your alternative approach must comply 
with the relevant statutes and regulations. FDA is willing to discuss an 
alternative approach with you to ensure that it complies with the 
relevant statutes and regulations.
    (3) Although guidance documents do not legally bind FDA, they 
represent the agency's current thinking. Therefore, FDA employees may 
depart from guidance documents only with appropriate justification and 
supervisory concurrence.
    (e) Can FDA use means other than a guidance document to communicate 
new agency policy or a new regulatory approach to a broad public 
audience? The agency may not use documents or other means of 
communication that are excluded from the definition of guidance document 
to informally communicate new or different regulatory expectations to a 
broad public audience for the first time. These GGP's must be followed 
whenever regulatory expectations that are not readily apparent from the 
statute or regulations are first communicated to a broad public 
audience.
    (f) How can you participate in the development and issuance of 
guidance documents? (1) You can provide input on

[[Page 164]]

guidance documents that FDA is developing under the procedures described 
in paragraph (g) of this section.
    (2) You can suggest areas for guidance document development. Your 
suggestions should address why a guidance document is necessary.
    (3) You can submit drafts of proposed guidance documents for FDA to 
consider. When you do so, you should mark the document ``Guidance 
Document Submission'' and submit it to Division of Dockets Management 
(HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.
    (4) You can, at any time, suggest that FDA revise or withdraw an 
already existing guidance document. Your suggestion should address why 
the guidance document should be revised or withdrawn and, if applicable, 
how it should be revised.
    (5) Once a year, FDA will publish, both in the Federal Register and 
on the Internet, a list of possible topics for future guidance document 
development or revision during the next year. You can comment on this 
list (e.g., by suggesting alternatives or making recommendations on the 
topics that FDA is considering).
    (6) To participate in the development and issuance of guidance 
documents through one of the mechanisms described in paragraphs (f)(1), 
(f)(2), or (f)(4) of this section, you should contact the center or 
office that is responsible for the regulatory activity covered by the 
guidance document.
    (7) If FDA agrees to draft or revise a guidance document, under a 
suggestion made under paragraphs (f)(1), (f)(2), (f)(3) or (f)(4) of 
this section, you can participate in the development of that guidance 
document under the procedures described in paragraph (g) of this 
section.
    (g) What are FDA's procedures for developing and issuing guidance 
documents? (1) FDA's procedures for the development and issuance of 
Level 1 guidance documents are as follows:
    (i) Before FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA 
can seek or accept early input from individuals or groups outside the 
agency. For example, FDA can do this by participating in or holding 
public meetings and workshops.
    (ii) After FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA 
will:
    (A) Publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the 
draft guidance document is available;
    (B) Post the draft guidance document on the Internet and make it 
available in hard copy; and
    (C) Invite your comment on the draft guidance document. Paragraph 
(h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments.
    (iii) After FDA prepares a draft of a Level 1 guidance document, FDA 
also can:
    (A) Hold public meetings or workshops; or
    (B) Present the draft guidance document to an advisory committee for 
review.
    (iv) After providing an opportunity for public comment on a Level 1 
guidance document, FDA will:
    (A) Review any comments received and prepare the final version of 
the guidance document that incorporates suggested changes, when 
appropriate;
    (B) Publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the 
guidance document is available;
    (C) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available 
in hard copy; and
    (D) Implement the guidance document.
    (v) After providing an opportunity for comment, FDA may decide that 
it should issue another draft of the guidance document. In this case, 
FDA will follow the steps in paragraphs (g)(1)(ii), (g)(1)(iii), and 
(g)(1)(iv) of this section.
    (2) FDA will not seek your comment before it implements a Level 1 
guidance document if the agency determines that prior public 
participation is not feasible or appropriate.
    (3) FDA will use the following procedures for developing and issuing 
Level 1 guidance documents under the circumstances described in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section:
    (i) After FDA prepares a guidance document, FDA will:
    (A) Publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing that the 
guidance document is available;
    (B) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available 
in hard copy;

[[Page 165]]

    (C) Immediately implement the guidance document; and
    (D) Invite your comment when it issues or publishes the guidance 
document. Paragraph (h) of this section tells you how to submit your 
comments.
    (ii) If FDA receives comments on the guidance document, FDA will 
review those comments and revise the guidance document when appropriate.
    (4) FDA will use the following procedures for developing and issuing 
Level 2 guidance documents:
    (i) After it prepares a guidance document, FDA will:
    (A) Post the guidance document on the Internet and make it available 
in hard copy;
    (B) Immediately implement the guidance document, unless FDA 
indicates otherwise when the document is made available; and
    (C) Invite your comment on the Level 2 guidance document. Paragraph 
(h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments.
    (ii) If FDA receives comments on the guidance document, FDA will 
review those comments and revise the document when appropriate. If a 
version is revised, the new version will be placed on the Internet.
    (5) You can comment on any guidance document at any time. Paragraph 
(h) of this section tells you how to submit your comments. FDA will 
revise guidance documents in response to your comments when appropriate.
    (h) How should you submit comments on a guidance document? (1) If 
you choose to submit comments on any guidance document under paragraph 
(g) of this section, you must send them to the Division of Dockets 
Management (HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.
    (2) Comments should identify the docket number on the guidance 
document, if such a docket number exists. For documents without a docket 
number, the title of the guidance document should be included.
    (3) Comments will be available to the public in accordance with 
FDA's regulations on submission of documents to the Division of Dockets 
Management specified in Sec.  10.20(j).
    (i) What standard elements must FDA include in a guidance document? 
(1) A guidance document must:
    (i) Include the term ``guidance,''
    (ii) Identify the center(s) or office(s) issuing the document,
    (iii) Identify the activity to which and the people to whom the 
document applies,
    (iv) Prominently display a statement of the document's nonbinding 
effect,
    (v) Include the date of issuance,
    (vi) Note if it is a revision to a previously issued guidance and 
identify the document that it replaces, and
    (vii) Contain the word ``draft'' if the document is a draft 
guidance.
    (2) Guidance documents must not include mandatory language such as 
``shall,'' ``must,'' ``required,'' or ``requirement,'' unless FDA is 
using these words to describe a statutory or regulatory requirement.
    (3) When issuing draft guidance documents that are the product of 
international negotiations (e.g., guidances resulting from the 
International Conference on Harmonisation), FDA need not apply 
paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section. However, any final 
guidance document issued according to this provision must contain the 
elements in paragraphs (i)(1) and (i)(2) of this section.
    (j) Who, within FDA, can approve issuance of guidance documents? 
Each center and office must have written procedures for the approval of 
guidance documents. Those procedures must ensure that issuance of all 
documents is approved by appropriate senior FDA officials.
    (k) How will FDA review and revise existing guidance documents? (1) 
The agency will periodically review existing guidance documents to 
determine whether they need to be changed or withdrawn.
    (2) When significant changes are made to the statute or regulations, 
the agency will review and, if appropriate, revise guidance documents 
relating to that changed statute or regulation.
    (3) As discussed in paragraph (f)(3) of this section, you may at any 
time suggest that FDA revise a guidance document.
    (l) How will FDA ensure that FDA staff are following GGP's? (1) All 
current and

[[Page 166]]

new FDA employees involved in the development, issuance, or application 
of guidance documents will be trained regarding the agency's GGP's.
    (2) FDA centers and offices will monitor the development and 
issuance of guidance documents to ensure that GGP's are being followed.
    (m) How can you get copies of FDA's guidance documents? FDA will 
make copies available in hard copy and, as feasible, through the 
Internet.
    (n) How will FDA keep you informed of the guidance documents that 
are available? (1) FDA will maintain on the Internet a current list of 
all guidance documents. New documents will be added to this list within 
30 days of issuance.
    (2) Once a year, FDA will publish in the Federal Register its 
comprehensive list of guidance documents. The comprehensive list will 
identify documents that have been added to the list or withdrawn from 
the list since the previous comprehensive list.
    (3) FDA's guidance document lists will include the name of the 
guidance document, issuance and revision dates, and information on how 
to obtain copies of the document.
    (o) What can you do if you believe that someone at FDA is not 
following these GGP's? If you believe that someone at FDA did not follow 
the procedures in this section or that someone at FDA treated a guidance 
document as a binding requirement, you should contact that person's 
supervisor in the center or office that issued the guidance document. If 
the issue cannot be resolved, you should contact the next highest 
supervisor. You can also contact the center or office ombudsman for 
assistance in resolving the issue. If you are unable to resolve the 
issue at the center or office level or if you feel that you are not 
making progress by going through the chain of command, you may ask the 
Office of the Chief Mediator and Ombudsman to become involved.

      Subpart C_Electronic Media Coverage of Public Administrative 
             Proceedings; Guideline on Policy and Procedures

    Source: 49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  10.200  Scope.

    This guideline describes FDA's policy and procedures applicable to 
electronic media coverage of agency public administrative proceedings. 
It is a guideline intended to clarify and explain FDA's policy on the 
presence and operation of electronic recording equipment at such 
proceedings and to assure uniform and consistent application of 
practices and procedures throughout the agency.



Sec.  10.203  Definitions.

    (a) Public administrative proceeding as used in this guideline means 
any FDA proceeding which the public has a right to attend. This includes 
a formal evidentiary public hearing as set forth in part 12, a public 
hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry as set forth in part 13, a 
public hearing before a Public Advisory Committee as set forth in part 
14, a public hearing before the Commissioner as set forth in part 15, a 
regulatory hearing before FDA as set forth in part 16, consumer exchange 
meetings, and Commissioner's public meetings with health professionals.
    (b) Advance notice as used in this guideline means written or 
telephone notification to FDA's Office of Public Affairs (Press 
Relations Staff) of intent to electronically record an agency public 
administrative proceeding.
    (c) Electronic recording as used in this guideline means any visual 
or audio recording made by videotape recording equipment or moving film 
camera, and/or other electronic recording equipment.

[49 FR 14726, Apr. 13, 1984, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989]



Sec.  10.204  General.

    (a) FDA has for many years willingly committed itself to a policy of 
openness. In many instances FDA has sought to make the open portions of

[[Page 167]]

agency public administrative proceedings more accessible to public 
participation. Similarly, FDA has sought, wherever possible, to allow 
full written media access to its proceedings, so that members of the 
press would have the opportunity to provide first-hand reports. However, 
because electronic media coverage presents certain difficulties that are 
easier to resolve with advance notice to the agency and all 
participants, FDA believes that codification of its policy will 
facilitate and further increase media access to its public 
administrative proceedings. The agency intends to refer to this 
guideline when notices of hearing, or individual advisory committee 
meetings, are published in the Federal Register. Thus, all parties to a 
proceeding will be on notice that the proceeding may be recorded 
electronically and any person interested in videotaping or otherwise 
recording the proceeding will be notified that there are established 
procedures to be followed.
    (b) The designated presiding officer of a public administrative 
proceeding retains the existing discretionary authority set forth in 
specific regulations pertaining to each type of administrative 
proceeding to regulate the conduct of the proceeding over which he or 
she presides. The responsibilities of the presiding officer, established 
elsewhere in parts 10 through 16, include an obligation to be concerned 
with the timely conduct of a hearing, the limited availability of 
certain witnesses, and reducing disruptions to the proceeding which may 
occur. Each proceeding varies, and the presiding officer cannot 
anticipate all that might occur. Discretionary authority to regulate 
conduct at a proceeding has traditionally been granted to presiding 
officers to enable them to fulfill their responsibility to maintain a 
fair and orderly hearing conducted in an expeditious manner.
    (c) This guideline provides the presiding officer with a degree of 
flexibility in that it sets forth the agency's policy as well as the 
procedures that presiding officers should ordinarily follow, but from 
which they may depart in particular situations if necessary, subject to 
the presumption of openness of public proceedings to electronic media 
coverage. The presiding officer's discretion to establish additional 
procedures or to limit electronic coverage is to be exercised only in 
the unusual circumstances defined in this guideline. Even though a 
presiding officer may establish additional procedures or limits as may 
be required in a particular situation, he or she will be guided by the 
policy expressed in this guideline in establishing these conditions. The 
presiding officer may also be less restrictive, taking into account such 
factors as the duration of a hearing and the design of the room.
    (d) If a portion or all of a proceeding is closed to the public 
because material is to be discussed that is not disclosable to the 
public under applicable laws, the proceeding also will be closed to 
electronic media coverage.
    (e) The agency requests advance notice of intent to record a 
proceeding electronically to facilitate the orderly conduct of the 
proceeding. Knowledge of anticipated media coverage will allow the 
presiding officer to make any special arrangements required by the 
circumstances of the proceeding. The agency believes that this guideline 
establishes sufficiently specific criteria to promote uniformity.
    (f) The agency would like to allow all interested media 
representatives to videotape a proceeding in which they have an 
interest. However, should space limitations preclude a multitude of 
cameras, the presiding officer may require pool sharing. In such a case, 
pool sharing arrangements of the resulting videotape should be made 
between those allowed to film and those who were excluded. Arrangements 
for who is designated to present the pool and a method of distributing 
the resulting film or tape may be determined by the established 
networks' pooling system. However, the agency has a strong commitment to 
ensuring that media representatives other than the major networks also 
be able to obtain a copy of the tape at cost. FDA is concerned that if 
the network pool representative wishes to record only a short portion of 
a proceeding, but an excluded party wishes to record the entire 
proceeding, confusion will result. The agency expects the interested 
media representatives to negotiate a suitable agreement among themselves

[[Page 168]]

before commencement of the proceeding. For example, the network pool 
representatives might agree to record a portion of the proceeding up to 
a break in the proceeding, at which time, while the network 
representative is disassembling equipment, another media representative 
might set up to continue recording. If an agreement cannot be reached 
before the proceeding, the agency will use the time of receipt of any 
advance notice to determine the representation for each category of 
media, e.g., one network reporter, one independent reporter. The agency 
recommends that parties intending to videotape provide as much advance 
notice as possible, so that the agency may best respond to the needs of 
the electronic media.
    (g) To ensure the timely conduct of agency hearings and to prevent 
disruptions, equipment is to be stationary during a proceeding and 
should be set up and taken down when the proceeding is not in progress. 
As noted previously, the presiding officer may, at his or her 
discretion, be less restrictive if appropriate.
    (h) The agency recognizes that electronic media representatives may 
desire only short footage of a proceeding, a facsimile of the 
proceeding, and/or interview opportunities and may be unnecessarily 
restricted by requirements for setting up before a proceeding and then 
waiting until a break in the proceeding before being permitted to take 
down their equipment. To accommodate this possibility, FDA's Press 
Relations Staff will attempt to make arrangements to respond to such 
needs by, for example, requesting that the presiding officer provide a 
break shortly after commencement of the proceeding to permit take down 
of equipment.
    (i) The agency is making a full commitment to allowing, whenever 
possible, electronic coverage of its public administrative proceedings 
subject to the limited restrictions established in this guideline.



Sec.  10.205  Electronic media coverage of public administrative
proceedings.

    (a) A person may record electronically any open public 
administrative proceeding, subject to the procedures specified in this 
guideline. The procedures include a presumption that agency public 
proceedings are open to the electronic media. Whenever possible, FDA 
will permit all interested persons access to record agency public 
administrative proceedings. Restrictions other than those listed in 
Sec.  10.206 will be imposed only under exceptional circumstances.
    (b) A videotape recording of an FDA public administrative proceeding 
is not an official record of the proceeding. The only official record is 
the written transcript of the proceeding, which is taken by the official 
reporter.



Sec.  10.206  Procedures for electronic media coverage of agency
public administrative proceedings.

    (a) To facilitate the agency's response to media needs, a person 
intending to videotape an FDA public administrative proceeding should, 
whenever possible, provide advance notice to the Press Relations Staff 
(HFI-20), Office of Public Affairs, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 
Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, in writing or by telephone (telephone 
301-443-4177), at least 48 hours in advance of the proceeding. The Press 
Relations Staff will inform the presiding officer that the proceeding 
will be attended by representatives of the electronic media, and 
ascertain whether any special provisions in addition to those set forth 
in this subpart are required by the presiding officer. If so, the Press 
Relations Staff will function as a liaison between the presiding officer 
and the person intending to record the proceeding in facilitating any 
procedures in addition to those outlined in this subpart. The presiding 
officer will not deny access for failure to provide a 48-hour advance 
notice. Any advance notice may describe the intended length of recording 
if known, the amount and type of equipment to be used, and any special 
needs such as interviews.
    (b) Cameras should be completely set up before a proceeding is 
scheduled to begin or during a break in the proceeding and should remain 
standing in the area designated for electronic media equipment. Cameras 
may be taken down only during breaks or after the hearing is over. 
Roving cameras

[[Page 169]]

will not be permitted during the proceeding. Any artificial lighting 
should be unobtrusive. Microphones, like cameras, should be in place 
before the start of a proceeding and may be taken down as indicated in 
this paragraph.
    (c) When space in the hearing room is limited, the presiding officer 
may restrict the number of cameras or the equipment present. Should such 
a restriction become necessary, the pool arrangements are the 
responsibility of the participating media. The agency encourages the 
network pool to make copies of the tape, film, or other product 
available at cost to nonpool participants. However, if this is not 
possible, the agency may need to use the time of receipt of any advance 
notice to determine the representation for each category, e.g., one 
network reporter, one independent reporter, etc.
    (d) Off the record portions of a proceeding may not be videotaped.
    (e) Before or during the proceeding, the presiding officer may 
establish other conditions specific to the proceeding for which the 
request is being made. These conditions may be more or less restrictive 
than those stated in this guideline, except that the presiding officer 
shall observe the agency's presumption of openness of its public 
proceedings to the electronic media. Only a substantial and clear threat 
to the agency's interests in order, fairness, and timeliness authorizes 
the presiding officer to impose additional restrictions. This threat 
must outweigh the public interest in electronic media coverage of agency 
proceedings. Additional restrictions shall be narrowly drawn to the 
particular circumstances. The following factors are listed to assist 
presiding officers in determining whether the agency's interest is 
sufficiently compelling to call for the unusual step of imposing 
additional restrictions. Generally this step is justified when one of 
the following factors is met:
    (1) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of 
disruption that clearly cannot be contained by the procedures 
established in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.
    (2) Electronic recording would result in a substantial likelihood of 
prejudicial impact on the fairness of the proceeding or the substantive 
discussion in a proceeding.
    (3) There is a substantial likelihood that a witness' ability to 
testify may be impaired due to unique personal circumstances such as the 
age or psychological state of the witness or the particularly personal 
or private nature of the witness' testimony, if the witness' testimony 
were electronically recorded.
    (f) Before the proceeding, the Press Relations Staff will, upon 
request, provide written copies of any additional conditions imposed by 
the presiding officer (as described in paragraph (e) of this section) to 
requesting members of the media. Any appeals should be made in 
accordance with paragraph (h) of this section.
    (g) The presiding officer retains authority to restrict or 
discontinue videotaping or other recording of a proceeding, or parts of 
a proceeding, should such a decision become necessary. The presiding 
officer's responsibility to conduct the hearing includes the right and 
duty to remove a source of substantial disruption. In exercising his or 
her authority, the presiding officer shall observe the presumption that 
agency public proceedings are open to the electronic media. The 
presiding officer shall exercise his or her discretion to restrict or 
discontinue electronic coverage of a public proceeding, or portions of a 
public proceeding, only if he or she determines that the agency's 
interest in the fair and orderly administrative process is substantially 
threatened. A clear and substantial threat to the integrity of agency 
proceedings must clearly outweigh the public interest in electronic 
media coverage of the proceedings before additional restrictions are 
imposed on the electronic media during the course of the proceedings. 
The factors noted in paragraph (e) of this section indicate the kind of 
substantial threat to the agency interests that may require imposing 
additional restrictions during the course of the proceedings. If 
additional requirements are established during the hearing, the 
presiding officer shall notify immediately the Deputy Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs of that fact by telephone and submit a written 
explanation of the circumstances that

[[Page 170]]

necessitated such an action within 24 hours or sooner if requested by 
the Deputy Commissioner. In the absence or unavailability of the Deputy 
Commissioner, the presiding officer shall notify the Associate 
Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs.
    (h) A decision by a presiding officer, made either before the 
proceeding or during the course of a proceeding, to establish 
requirements in addition to the minimum standards set forth in this 
guideline may be appealed by any adversely affected person who intends 
to record the proceeding electronically. Appeals may be made in writing 
or by phone to the Deputy Commissioner or, in his or her absence, to the 
Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. The filing of an appeal, 
whether before or during a proceeding, does not require the presiding 
officer to interrupt the proceeding. However, the Deputy Commissioner 
or, in his or her absence, the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory 
Affairs will resolve an appeal as expeditiously as possible so as to 
preserve, to the extent possible, the reporters' opportunity to record 
the proceedings.

                      Subpart B_Electronic Records



Sec.  11.10  Controls for closed systems.

    Persons who use closed systems to create, modify, maintain, or 
transmit electronic records shall employ procedures and controls 
designed to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and, when appropriate, 
the confidentiality of electronic records, and to ensure that the signer 
cannot readily repudiate the signed record as not genuine. Such 
procedures and controls shall include the following:
    (a) Validation of systems to ensure accuracy, reliability, 
consistent intended performance, and the ability to discern invalid or 
altered records.
    (b) The ability to generate accurate and complete copies of records 
in both human readable and electronic form suitable for inspection, 
review, and copying by the agency. Persons should contact the agency if 
there are any questions regarding the ability of the agency to perform 
such review and copying of the electronic records.
    (c) Protection of records to enable their accurate and ready 
retrieval throughout the records retention period.
    (d) Limiting system access to authorized individuals.
    (e) Use of secure, computer-generated, time-stamped audit trails to 
independently record the date and time of operator entries and actions 
that create, modify, or delete electronic records. Record changes shall 
not obscure previously recorded information. Such audit trail 
documentation shall be retained for a period at least as long as that 
required for the subject electronic records and shall be available for 
agency review and copying.
    (f) Use of operational system checks to enforce permitted sequencing 
of steps and events, as appropriate.
    (g) Use of authority checks to ensure that only authorized 
individuals can use the system, electronically sign a record, access the 
operation or computer system input or output device, alter a record, or 
perform the operation at hand.
    (h) Use of device (e.g., terminal) checks to determine, as 
appropriate, the validity of the source of data input or operational 
instruction.
    (i) Determination that persons who develop, maintain, or use 
electronic record/electronic signature systems have the education, 
training, and experience to perform their assigned tasks.
    (j) The establishment of, and adherence to, written policies that 
hold individuals accountable and responsible for actions initiated under 
their electronic

[[Page 173]]

signatures, in order to deter record and signature falsification.
    (k) Use of appropriate controls over systems documentation 
including:
    (1) Adequate controls over the distribution of, access to, and use 
of documentation for system operation and maintenance.
    (2) Revision and change control procedures to maintain an audit 
trail that documents time-sequenced development and modification of 
systems documentation.



Sec.  11.30  Controls for open systems.

    Persons who use open systems to create, modify, maintain, or 
transmit electronic records shall employ procedures and controls 
designed to ensure the authenticity, integrity, and, as appropriate, the 
confidentiality of electronic records from the point of their creation 
to the point of their receipt. Such procedures and controls shall 
include those identified in Sec.  11.10, as appropriate, and additional 
measures such as document encryption and use of appropriate digital 
signature standards to ensure, as necessary under the circumstances, 
record authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality.



Sec.  11.50  Signature manifestations.

    (a) Signed electronic records shall contain information associated 
with the signing that clearly indicates all of the following:
    (1) The printed name of the signer;
    (2) The date and time when the signature was executed; and
    (3) The meaning (such as review, approval, responsibility, or 
authorship) associated with the signature.
    (b) The items identified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) of 
this section shall be subject to the same controls as for electronic 
records and shall be included as part of any human readable form of the 
electronic record (such as electronic display or printout).



Sec.  11.70  Signature/record linking.

    Electronic signatures and handwritten signatures executed to 
electronic records shall be linked to their respective electronic 
records to ensure that the signatures cannot be excised, copied, or 
otherwise transferred to falsify an electronic record by ordinary means.



                     Subpart C_Electronic Signatures



Sec.  11.100  General requirements.

    (a) Each electronic signature shall be unique to one individual and 
shall not be reused by, or reassigned to, anyone else.
    (b) Before an organization establishes, assigns, certifies, or 
otherwise sanctions an individual's electronic signature, or any element 
of such electronic signature, the organization shall verify the identity 
of the individual.
    (c) Persons using electronic signatures shall, prior to or at the 
time of such use, certify to the agency that the electronic signatures 
in their system, used on or after August 20, 1997, are intended to be 
the legally binding equivalent of traditional handwritten signatures.
    (1) The certification shall be submitted in paper form and signed 
with a traditional handwritten signature, to the Office of Regional 
Operations (HFC-100), 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.
    (2) Persons using electronic signatures shall, upon agency request, 
provide additional certification or testimony that a specific electronic 
signature is the legally binding equivalent of the signer's handwritten 
signature.



Sec.  11.200  Electronic signature components and controls.

    (a) Electronic signatures that are not based upon biometrics shall:
    (1) Employ at least two distinct identification components such as 
an identification code and password.
    (i) When an individual executes a series of signings during a 
single, continuous period of controlled system access, the first signing 
shall be executed using all electronic signature components; subsequent 
signings shall be executed using at least one electronic signature 
component that is only executable by, and designed to be used only by, 
the individual.
    (ii) When an individual executes one or more signings not performed 
during a single, continuous period of controlled system access, each 
signing

[[Page 174]]

shall be executed using all of the electronic signature components.
    (2) Be used only by their genuine owners; and
    (3) Be administered and executed to ensure that attempted use of an 
individual's electronic signature by anyone other than its genuine owner 
requires collaboration of two or more individuals.
    (b) Electronic signatures based upon biometrics shall be designed to 
ensure that they cannot be used by anyone other than their genuine 
owners.



Sec.  11.300  Controls for identification codes/passwords.

    Persons who use electronic signatures based upon use of 
identification codes in combination with passwords shall employ controls 
to ensure their security and integrity. Such controls shall include:
    (a) Maintaining the uniqueness of each combined identification code 
and password, such that no two individuals have the same combination of 
identification code and password.
    (b) Ensuring that identification code and password issuances are 
periodically checked, recalled, or revised (e.g., to cover such events 
as password aging).
    (c) Following loss management procedures to electronically 
deauthorize lost, stolen, missing, or otherwise potentially compromised 
tokens, cards, and other devices that bear or generate identification 
code or password information, and to issue temporary or permanent 
replacements using suitable, rigorous controls.
    (d) Use of transaction safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of 
passwords and/or identification codes, and to detect and report in an 
immediate and urgent manner any attempts at their unauthorized use to 
the system security unit, and, as appropriate, to organizational 
management.
    (e) Initial and periodic testing of devices, such as tokens or 
cards, that bear or generate identification code or password information 
to ensure that they function properly and have not been altered in an 
unauthorized manner.

    (2) Each objection is separately numbered.
    (3) Each objection specifies with particularity the provision of the 
regulation or proposed order objected to.
    (4) Each objection on which a hearing is requested specifically so 
states. Failure to request a hearing on an objection constitutes a 
waiver of the right to a hearing on that objection.
    (5) Each objection for which a hearing is requested includes a 
detailed description and analysis of the factual information to be 
presented in support of the objection. Failure to include a description 
and analysis for an objection constitutes a waiver of the right to a 
hearing on that objection. The description and analysis may be used only 
for the purpose of determining whether a hearing has been justified 
under Sec.  12.24, and do not limit the evidence that may be presented

submitted to the Division of Dockets Management and will be accepted for 
filing if they meet the following conditions:
    (1) They are submitted on or before the 30th day after the date of 
publication of the notice of opportunity for hearing.
    (2) They comply with Sec. Sec.  314.200, 514.200, or 601.7(a).
    (c) If an objection or request for a public hearing fails to meet 
the requirements of this section and the deficiency becomes known to the 
Division of Dockets Management, the Division of Dockets Management shall 
return it with a copy of the applicable regulations, indicating those 
provisions not complied with. A deficient objection or request for a 
hearing may be supplemented and subsequently filed if submitted within 
the 30-day time period specified in Sec.  12.20(e) or Sec.  12.21(b).
    (d) If another person objects to a regulation issued in response to 
a petition submitted under Sec.  12.20(a)(2), the petitioner may submit 
a written reply to the Division of Dockets Management.

[[Page 177]]



Sec.  12.23  Notice of filing of objections.

    As soon as practicable after the expiration of the time for filing 
objections to and requests for hearing on agency action involving the 
issuance, amendment, or revocation of a regulation under sections 
502(n), 701(e), or 721(d) of the act or sections 4 or 5 of the Fair 
Packaging and Labeling Act, the Commissioner shall publish a notice in 
the Federal Register specifying those parts of the regulation that have 
been stayed by the filing of proper objections and, if no objections 
have been filed, stating that fact. The notice does not constitute a 
determination that a hearing is justified on any objections or requests 
for hearing that have been filed. When to do so will cause no undue 
delay, the notice required by this section may be combined with the 
notices described in Sec. Sec.  12.28 and 12.35.



Sec.  12.24  Ruling on objections and requests for hearing.

    (a) As soon as possible the Commissioner will review all objections 
and requests for hearing filed under Sec.  12.22 and determine--
    (1) Whether the regulation should be modified or revoked under Sec.  
12.26;
    (2) Whether a hearing has been justified; and
    (3) Whether, if requested, a hearing before a Public Board of 
Inquiry under part 13 or before a public advisory committee under part 
14 or before the Commissioner under part 15 has been justified.
    (b) A request for a hearing will be granted if the material 
submitted shows the following:
    (1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution 
at a hearing. A hearing will not be granted on issues of policy or law.
    (2) The factual issue can be resolved by available and specifically 
identified reliable evidence. A hearing will not be granted on the basis 
of mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and 
contentions.
    (3) The data and information submitted, if established at a hearing, 
would be adequate to justify resolution of the factual issue in the way 
sought by the person. A hearing will be denied if the Commissioner 
concludes that the data and information submitted are insufficient to 
justify the factual determination urged, even if accurate.
    (4) Resolution of the factual issue in the way sought by the person 
is adequate to justify the action requested. A hearing will not be 
granted on factual issues that are not determinative with respect to the 
action requested, e.g., if the Commissioner concludes that the action 
would be the same even if the factual issue were resolved in the way 
sought, or if a request is made that a final regulation include a 
provision not reasonably encompassed by the proposal. A hearing will be 
granted upon proper objection and request when a food standard or other 
regulation is shown to have the effect of excluding or otherwise 
affecting a product or ingredient.
    (5) The action requested is not inconsistent with any provision in 
the act or any regulation in this chapter particularizing statutory 
standards. The proper procedure in those circumstances is for the person 
requesting the hearing to petition for an amendment or waiver of the 
regulation involved.
    (6) The requirements in other applicable regulations, e.g., 
Sec. Sec.  10.20, 12.21, 12.22, 314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a), and in 
the notice promulgating the final regulation or the notice of 
opportunity for hearing are met.
    (c) In making the determination in paragraph (a) of this section, 
the Commissioner may use any of the optional procedures specified in 
Sec.  10.30(h) or in other applicable regulations, e.g., Sec. Sec.  
314.200, 514.200, and 601.7(a).
    (d) If it is uncertain whether a hearing has been justified under 
the principles in paragraph (b) of this section, and the Commissioner 
concludes that summary decision against the person requesting a hearing 
should be considered, the Commissioner may serve upon the person by 
registered mail a proposed order denying a hearing. The person has 30 
days after receipt of the proposed order to demonstrate that the 
submission justifies a hearing.

Sec.  12.26  Modification or revocation of regulation or order.

    If the Commissioner determines upon review of an objection or 
request for

[[Page 178]]

hearing that the regulation or order should be modified or revoked, the 
Commissioner will promptly take such action by notice in the Federal 
Register. Further objections to or requests for hearing on the 
modification or revocation may be submitted under Sec. Sec.  12.20 
through 12.22 but no further issue may be taken with other provisions in 
the regulation or order. Objections and requests for hearing that are 
not affected by the modification or revocation will remain on file and 
be acted upon in due course.



Sec.  12.28  Denial of hearing in whole or in part.

    If the Commissioner determines upon review of the objections or 
requests for hearing that a hearing is not justified, in whole or in 
part, a notice of the determination will be published.
    (a) The notice will state whether the hearing is denied in whole or 
in part. If the hearing is denied in part, the notice will be combined 
with the notice of hearing required by Sec.  12.35, and will specify the 
objections and requests for hearing that have been granted and denied.
    (1) Any denial will be explained. A denial based on an analysis of 
the information submitted to justify a hearing will explain the 
inadequacy of the information.
    (2) The notice will confirm or modify or stay the effective date of 
the regulation or order involved.
    (b) The record of the administrative proceeding relating to denial 
of a public hearing in whole or in part on an objection or request for 
hearing consists of the following:
    (1) If the proceeding involves a regulation--
    (i) The documents specified in Sec.  10.40(g);
    (ii) The objections and requests for hearing filed by the Division 
of Dockets Management;
    (iii) If the proceeding involves a color additive regulation 
referred to an advisory committee in accordance with section 
721(b)(5)(C) of the act, the committee's report and the record of the 
committee's proceeding; and
    (iv) The notice denying a formal evidentiary public hearing.
    (2) If the proceeding involves an order--
    (i) The notice of opportunity for hearing;
    (ii) The requests for hearing filed by the Division of Dockets 
Management;
    (iii) The transcripts, minutes of meetings, reports, Federal 
Register notices, and other documents constituting the record of any of 
the optional procedures specified in Sec.  12.24(c) used by the 
Commissioner, but not the transcript of a closed portion of a public 
advisory committee meeting; and
    (iv) The notice denying the hearing.
    (c) The record specified in paragraph (b) of this section is the 
exclusive record for the Commissioner's decision on the complete or 
partial denial of a hearing. The record of the proceeding will be closed 
as of the date of the Commissioner's decision unless another date is 
specified. A person who requested and was denied a hearing may submit a 
petition for reconsideration under Sec.  10.33 or a petition for stay of 
action under Sec.  10.35. A person who wishes to rely upon information 
or views not included in the administrative record shall submit them to 
the Commissioner with a petition under Sec.  10.25(a) to modify the 
final regulation or order.
    (d) Denial of a request for a hearing in whole or in part is final 
agency action reviewable in the courts, under the statutory provisions 
governing the matter involved, as of the date of publication of the 
denial in the Federal Register.
    (1) Before requesting a court for a stay of action pending review, a 
person shall first submit a petition for a stay of action under Sec.  
10.35.
    (2) Under 28 U.S.C. 2112(a), FDA will request consolidation of all 
petitions on a particular matter.
    (3) The time for filing a petition for judicial review of a denial 
of a hearing on an objection or issue begins on the date the denial is 
published in the Federal Register, (i) When an objection or issues 
relates to a regulation, if a hearing is denied on all objections and 
issues concerning a part of the proposal the effectiveness of which has 
not been deferred pending a hearing on other parts of the proposal; or 
(ii) when an issue relates to an order, if a hearing is

[[Page 179]]

denied on all issues relating to a particular new drug application, new 
animal drug application, device premarket approval application or 
product development protocol, or biologics license. The failure to file 
a petition for judicial review within the period established in the 
statutory provision governing the matter involved constitutes a waiver 
of the right to judicial review of the objection or issue, regardless 
whether a hearing has been granted on other objections and issues.



Sec.  12.30  Judicial review after waiver of hearing on a regulation.

    (a) A person with a right to submit objections and a request for 
hearing under Sec.  12.20(d) may submit objections and waive the right 
to a hearing. The waiver may be either an explicit statement, or a 
failure to request a hearing, as provided in 12.22(a)(4).
    (b) If a person waives the right to a hearing, the Commissioner will 
rule upon the person's objections under Sec. Sec.  12.24 through 12.28. 
As a matter of discretion, the Commissioner may also order a hearing on 
the matter under any of the provisions of this part.
    (c) If the Commissioner rules adversely on a person's objection, the 
person may petition for judicial review in a U.S. Court of Appeals under 
the act.
    (1) The record for judicial review is the record designated in Sec.  
12.28(b)(1).
    (2) The time for filing a petition for judicial review begins as of 
the date of publication of the Commissioner's ruling on the objections.



Sec.  12.32  Request for alternative form of hearing.

    (a) A person with a right to request a hearing may waive that right 
and request one of the following alternatives:
    (1) A hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry under part 13.
    (2) A hearing before a public advisory committee under part 14.
    (3) A hearing before the Commissioner under part 15.
    (b) The request--
    (1) May be on the person's own initiative or at the suggestion of 
the Commissioner.
    (2) Must be submitted in the form of a citizen petition under Sec.  
10.30 before publication of a notice of hearing under Sec.  12.35 or a 
denial of hearing under Sec.  12.28; and
    (3) Must be--
    (i) In lieu of a request for a hearing under this part; or
    (ii) If submitted after or with a request for hearing, in the form 
of a waiver of the right to request a hearing conditioned on an 
alternative form of hearing. Upon acceptance by the Commissioner, the 
waiver becomes binding and may be withdrawn only by waiving any right to 
any form of hearing unless the Commissioner determines otherwise.
    (c) When more than one person requests and justifies a hearing under 
this part, an alternative form of hearing may by used only if all the 
persons concur and waive their right to request a hearing under this 
part.
    (d) The Commissioner will determine whether an alternative form of 
hearing should be used, and if so, which alternative is acceptable, 
after considering the requests submitted and the appropriateness of the 
alternatives for the issues raised in the objections. The Commissioner's 
acceptance is binding unless, for good cause, the Commissioner 
determines otherwise.
    (e) The Commissioner will publish a notice of an alternative form of 
hearing setting forth the following information:
    (1) The regulation or order that is the subject of the hearing.
    (2) A statement specifying any part of the regulation or order that 
has been stayed by operation of law or in the Commissioner's discretion.
    (3) The time, date, and place of the hearing, or a statment that 
such information will be contained in a later notice.
    (4) The parties to the hearing.
    (5) The issues at the hearing. The statement of issues determines 
the scope of the hearing.
    (6) If the hearing will be conducted by a Public Board of Inquiry, 
the time within which--
    (i) The parties should submit nominees for the Board under Sec.  
13.10(b);
    (ii) A notice of participation under Sec.  12.45 should be filed; 
and

[[Page 180]]

    (iii) Participants should submit written information under Sec.  
13.25. The notice will list the contents of the portions of the 
administrative record relevant to the issues at the hearing before the 
Board. The portions listed will be placed on public display in the 
office of the Division of Dockets Management before the notice is 
published. Additional copies of material already submitted under Sec.  
13.25 need not be included with any later submissions.
    (f)(1) The decision of a hearing before a Public Board of Inquiry or 
a public advisory committee under this section has legal status of and 
will be handled as an initial decision under Sec.  12.120.
    (2) The decision of a public hearing before the Commissioner under 
this section will be issued as a final order. The final order will have 
the same content as an initial decision, as specified in Sec.  12.120 
(b) and (c).
    (3) Thereafter, the participants in the proceeding may pursue the 
administrative and court remedies specified in Sec. Sec.  12.120 through 
12.159.
    (g) If a hearing before a public advisory committee or a hearing 
before the Commissioner is used as an alternative form of hearing, all 
submissions will be made to the Division of Dockets Management, and 
Sec.  10.20(j) governs their availability for public examination and 
copying.
    (h) This section does not affect the right to an opportunity for a 
hearing before a public advisory committee under section 515(g)(2) of 
the act regarding device premarket approval applications and product 
development protocols. Advisory committee hearing procedures are found 
in part 14.



Sec.  12.35  Notice of hearing; stay of action.

    (a) If the Commissioner determines upon review of the objections and 
requests for hearing that a hearing is justified on any issue, the 
Commissioner will publish a notice setting forth the following:
    (1) The regulation or order that is the subject of the hearing.
    (2) A statement specifying any part of the regulation or order that 
has been stayed by operation of law or in the Commissioner's discretion.
    (3) The parties to the hearing.
    (4) The issues of fact on which a hearing has been justified.
    (5) A statement of any objections or requests for hearing for which 
a hearing has not been justified, which are subject to Sec.  12.28.

notice. The pre-hearing conference may not commence until after the time 
expires for filing the notice of participation required by Sec.  
12.45(a).
    (9) The time within which participants should submit written 
information and views under Sec.  12.85. The notice will list the 
contents of the portions of the administrative record relevant to the 
issues at the hearing. The portions listed will be placed on public 
display in the office of the Division of Dockets Management before the 
notice is published. Additional copies of material already submitted 
under Sec.  12.85 need not be included with any later submissions.
    (b) The statement of the issues determines the scope of the hearing 
and the matters on which evidence may be introduced. The issues may be 
revised by the presiding officer. A participant may obtain interlocutory 
review by the Commissioner of a decision by the presiding officer to 
revise the issues to include an issue on which the Commissioner has not 
granted a hearing or to eliminate an issue on which a hearing has been 
granted.
    (c) A hearing is deemed to begin on the date of publication of the 
notice of hearing.

[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 26375, June 18, 1982]



Sec.  12.37  Effective date of a regulation.

    (a) If no objections are filed and no hearing is requested on a

specified in the regulation as promulgated.
    (b) The Commissioner shall publish a confirmation of the effective

    (a) If a person who is subject to a notice of opportunity for 
hearing under Sec.  12.21(b) does not request a hearing, the

    (1) Publish a final order denying or withdrawing approval of an NDA, 
NADA, device premarket approval application, or biologics license, in 
whole or in part, or revoking a device product development protocol or 
notice of completion, or declaring that such a protocol has not been 
completed, and stating the effective date of the order; and
    (2) If the order involves withdrawal of approval of an NADA, 
forthwith revoke, in whole or in part, the applicable regulation, under 
section 512(i) of the act.

Sec.  12.50  Advice on public participation in hearings.

    (a) Designated agency contact. All inquiries from the public about 
scheduling, location, and general procedures should be addressed to the 
Deputy Commissioner for Policy (HF-22), Food and Drug Administration, 
5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, or telephone 301-443-3480. The 
staff of the Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs will attempt 
to respond promptly to all inquiries from members of the public, as well 
as to simple requests for information from participants in hearings.
    (b) Hearing schedule changes. Requests by hearing participants for 
changes in the schedule of a hearing or for filing documents, briefs, or 
other pleadings should be made in writing directly to the Administrative 
Law Judge (HF-3), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, 
Rockville, MD 20857.
    (c) Legal advice to individuals. FDA does not have the resources to 
provide legal advice to members of the public concerning participation 
in hearings. Furthermore, to do so would compromise the independence of 
the Commissioner's office and invite charges of improper interference in 
the hearing process. Accordingly, the Deputy Commissioner for Policy 
(HF-22) will not answer questions about the strengths or weaknesses of a 
party's position at a hearing, litigation strategy, or similar matters.
    (d) Role of the office of the Chief Counsel. Under no circumstances 
will the office of the Chief Counsel of FDA directly provide advice 
about a hearing to any person who is participating or may participate in 
the hearing. In every hearing, certain attorneys in the office are 
designated to represent the center or centers whose action is the 
subject of the hearing. Other members of the office, including 
ordinarily the Chief Counsel, are designated to advise the Commissioner 
on a final decision in the matter. It is not compatible with these 
functions, nor would it be professionally responsible, for the attorneys 
in the office of the Chief Counsel also to advise other participants in 
a hearing, or for any attorney who may be called on to advise the 
Commissioner to respond to inquiries from other participants in the 
hearing, for such participants may be urging views contrary to those of 
the center involved or to what may ultimately be the final conclusions 
of the Commissioner. Accordingly, members of the office of the Chief 
Counsel, other than the attorneys responsible for representing the 
center whose action is the subject of the hearing, will not answer 
questions about the hearing from any participant or potential 
participant.
    (e) Communication between participants and attorneys. Participants 
in a hearing may communicate with the attorneys responsible for 
representing the center whose action is the subject of the hearing, in 
the same way that they may communicate with counsel for any other party 
in interest about the presentation of matters at the hearing. It would 
be inappropriate to bar discussion of such matters as stipulations of 
fact, joint presentation of witnesses, or possible settlement of hearing 
issues. Members of the public, including participants at hearings, are 
advised, however, that all such communications, including those by 
telephone, will be recorded in memoranda that can be filed with the 
Division of Dockets Management.

[[Page 183]]

    (a) Specify and change the date, time, and place of oral hearings 
and conferences;
    (b) Establish the procedures for use in developing evidentiary 
facts, including the procedures in Sec.  12.92(b) and to rule on the 
need for oral testimony and cross-examination under Sec.  12.87(b);
    (c) Prepare statements of the areas of factual disagreement among 
the participants;
    (d) Hold conferences to settle, simplify, or determine the issues in 
a hearing or to consider other matters that may expedite the hearing;
    (e) Administer oaths and affirmations;
    (f) Control the course of the hearing and the conduct of the 
participants;
    (g) Examine witnesses and strike their testimony if they fail to 
respond fully to proper questions;
    (h) Rule on, admit, exclude, or limit evidence;
    (i) Set the time for filing pleadings;
    (j) Rule on motions and other procedural matters;
    (k) Rule on motions for summary decision under Sec.  12.93;
    (l) Conduct the hearing in stages if the number of parties is large 
or the issues are numerous and complex;
    (m) Waive, suspend, or modify any rule in this subpart under Sec.  
10.19 if the presiding officer determines that no party will be 
prejudiced, the ends of justice will be served, and the action is in 
accordance with law;
    (n) Strike the participation of any person under Sec.  12.45(e) or 
exclude any person from the hearing under Sec.  12.90, or take other 
reasonable disciplinary action; and
    (o) Take any action for the fair, expeditious, and orderly conduct 
of the hearing.



Sec.  12.75  Disqualification of presiding officer.

    (a) A participant may request the presiding officer to disqualify 
himself/herself and withdraw from the proceeding. The ruling on any such 
request may be appealed in accordance with Sec.  12.97(b).
    (b) A presiding officer who is aware of grounds for disqualification 
shall withdraw from the proceeding.



Sec.  12.78  Unavailability of presiding officer.

    (a) If the presiding officer is unable to act for any reason, the 
Commissioner will assign the powers and duties to another presiding 
officer. The substitution will not affect the hearing, except as the new 
presiding officer may order.
    (b) Any motion based on the substitution must be made within 10 
days.



                      Subpart E_Hearing Procedures



Sec.  12.80  Filing and service of submissions.

    (a) Submissions, including pleadings in a hearing, are to be filed 
with the Division of Dockets Management under Sec.  10.20 except that 
only two copies need be filed. To determine compliance with filing 
deadlines in a hearing, a submission is considered submitted on the date 
it is actually received by the Division of Dockets Management. When this 
part allows a response to a submission and prescribes a period of time 
for the filing of the response, an additional 3 days are allowed for the 
filing of the response if the submission is served by mail.
    (b) The person making a submission shall serve copies of it on the 
other participants. Submissions of documentary data and information are 
not required to be served on each participant, but any accompanying 
transmittal letter, pleading, summary, statement of position, 
certification under paragraph (d) of this section, or similar document 
must be served on each participant.
    (c) Service is accomplished by mailing a submission to the address 
shown in the notice of participation or by personal delivery.
    (d) All submissions are to be accompanied by a certificate of 
service, or a statement that service is not required.
    (e) No written submission or other portion of the administrative 
record may be held in confidence, except as provided in Sec.  12.105.



Sec.  12.82  Petition to participate in forma pauperis.

    (a) A participant who believes that compliance with the filing and 
service

[[Page 184]]

requirements of this section constitutes an unreasonable financial 
burden may submit to the Commissioner a petition to participate in forma 
pauperis.
    (b) The petition will be in the form specified in Sec.  10.30 except 
that the heading will be ``Request to Participate in Forma Pauperis, 
Docket No. ----.'' Filing and service requirements for the petition are 
described in paragraph (c) of this section, whether or not the petition 
is granted. The petition must demonstrate that either: (1) The person is 
indigent and a strong public interest justifies participation, or (2) 
the person's participation is in the public interest because it can be 
considered of primary benefit to the general public.
    (c) The Commissioner may grant or deny the petition. If the petition 
is granted, the participant need file only one copy of each submission 
with the Division of Dockets Management. The Division of Dockets 
Management will make sufficient additional copies for the administrative 
record, and serve a copy on each other participant.



Sec.  12.83  Advisory opinions.

    Before or during a hearing, a person may, under Sec.  10.85, request 
the Commissioner for an advisory opinion on whether any regulation or 
order under consideration in the proceeding applies to a specific 
situation.



Sec.  12.85  Disclosure of data and information by the participants.

    (a) Before the notice of hearing is published under Sec.  12.35, the 
director of the center responsible for the matters involved in the 
hearing shall submit the following to the Division of Dockets 
Management:
    (1) The relevant portions of the administrative record of the 
proceeding. Portions of the administrative record not relevant to the 
issues in the hearing are not part of the administrative record.
    (2) All documents in the director's files containing factual 
information, whether favorable or unfavorable to the director's 
position, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing. Files 
means the principal files in the center in which documents relating to 
the issues in the hearing are ordinarily kept, e.g., the food additive 
master file and the food additive petition in the case of issues 
concerning a food additive, or the new drug application in the case of 
issues concerning a new drug. Internal memoranda reflecting the 
deliberative process, and attorney work product and material prepared 
specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to 
be submitted.
    (3) All other documentary data and information relied upon.
    (4) A narrative position statement on the factual issues in the 
notice of hearing and the type of supporting evidence the director 
intends to introduce.
    (5) A signed statement that, to the director's best knowledge and 
belief, the submission complies with this section.
    (b) Within 60 days of the publication of the notice of hearing or, 
if no participant will be prejudiced, within another period of time set 
by the presiding officer, each participant shall submit to the Division 
of Dockets Management all data and information specified in paragraph 
(a)(2) through (5) of this section, and any objections that the 
administrative record filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is 
incomplete. With respect to the data and information specified in 
paragraph (a)(2) of this section, participants shall exercise reasonable 
diligence in identifying documents in files comparable to those 
described in that paragraph.
    (c) Submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section 
may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval of the 
presiding officer, upon a showing that the material contained in the 
supplement was not reasonably known or available when the submission was 
made or that the relevance of the material contained in the supplement 
could not reasonably have been forseen.
    (d) A participant's failure to comply substantially and in good 
faith with this section constitutes a waiver of the right to participate 
further in the hearing; failure of a party to comply constitutes a 
waiver of the right to a hearing.

    (e) Participants may reference each other's submissions. To reduce 
duplicative submissions, participants are encouraged to exchange and 
consolidate lists of documentary evidence. If a particular document is 
bulky or in limited supply and cannot reasonably be reproduced, and it 
constitutes relevant evidence, the presiding officer may authorize 
submission of a reduced number of copies.
    (f) The presiding officer will rule on questions relating to this 
section.

Sec.  12.87  Purpose; oral and written testimony; burden of proof.

    (a) The objective of a formal evidentiary hearing is the fair 
determination of relevant facts consistent with the right of all 
interested persons to participate and the public interest in promptly 
settling controversial matters affecting the public health and welfare.
    (b) Accordingly, the evidence at a hearing is to be developed to the 
maximum extent through written submissions, including written direct 
testimony, which may be in narrative or in question-and-answer form.
    (1) In a hearing, the issues may have general applicability and 
depend on general facts that do not concern particular action of a 
specific party, e.g., the safety or effectiveness of a class of drug 
products, the safety of a food or color additive, or a definition and 
standard of identity for a food; or the issues may have specific 
applicability to past action and depend upon particular facts concerning 
only that party, e.g., the applicability of a grandfather clause to a 
particular brand of a drug or the failure of a particular manufacturer 
to meet required manufacturing and processing specifications or other 
general standards.
    (i) If the proceeding involves general issues, direct testimony will 
be submitted in writing, except on a showing that written direct 
testimony is insufficient for a full and true disclosure of relevant 
facts and that the participant will be prejudiced if unable to present 
oral direct testimony. If the proceeding involves particular issues, 
each party may determine whether, and the extent to which, each wishes 
to present direct testimony orally or in writing.
    (ii) Oral cross-examination of witnesses will be permitted if it 
appears that alternative means of developing the evidence are 
insufficient for a full and true disclosure of the facts and that the 
party requesting oral cross-examination will be prejudiced by denial of 
the request or that oral cross-examination is the most effective and 
efficient means to clarify the matters at issue.
    (2) Witnesses shall give testimony under oath.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, in a 
hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a regulation or order, 
the originator of the proposal or petition or of any significant 
modification will be, within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 556(d), the 
proponent of the regulation or order, and will have the burden of proof. 
A participant who proposes to substitute a new provision for a provision 
objected to has the burden of proof in relation to the new provision.
    (d) At a hearing involving issuing, amending, or revoking a 
regulation or order relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug, 
device, food additive, or color additive, the participant who is 
contending that the product is safe or effective or both and who is 
requesting approval or contesting withdrawal of approval has the burden 
of proof in establishing safety or effectiveness or both and thus the 
right to approval. The burden of proof remains on that participant in an 
amendment or revocation proceeding.

[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 64 FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999]



Sec.  12.89  Participation of nonparties.

    (a) A nonparty participant may--
    (1) Attend all conferences (including the prehearing conference), 
oral proceedings, and arguments;
    (2) Submit written testimony and documentary evidence for inclusion 
in the record;
    (3) File written objections, briefs, and other pleadings; and
    (4) Present oral argument.
    (b) A nonparty participant may not--
    (1) Submit written interrogatories; and

[[Page 186]]

    (2) Conduct cross-examination.
    (c) A person whose petition is the subject of the hearing has the 
same right as a party.
    (d) A nonparty participant will be permitted additional rights if 
the presiding officer concludes that the participant's interests would 
not be adequately protected otherwise or that broader participation is 
required for a full and true disclosure of the facts, but the rights of 
a nonparty participant may not exceed the rights of a party.

[44 FR 22339, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 48 FR 51770, Nov. 14, 1983]



Sec.  12.90  Conduct at oral hearings or conferences.

    All participants in a hearing will conduct themselves with dignity 
and observe judicial standards of practice and ethics. They may not 
indulge in personal attacks, unseemly wrangling, or intemperate 
accusations or characterizations. Representatives of parties shall, to 
the extent possible, restrain clients from improprieties in connection 
with any proceeding. Disrespectful, disorderly, or contumacious language 
or conduct, refusal to comply with directions, use of dilatory tactics, 
or refusal to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly and ethical 
conduct during any hearing, constitute grounds for immediate exclusion 
from the proceeding by the presiding officer.



Sec.  12.91  Time and place of prehearing conference.

    A prehearing conference will commence at the date, time, and place 
announced in the notice of hearing, or in a later notice, or as 
specified by the presiding officer in a notice modifying a prior notice. 
At that conference the presiding officer will establish the methods and 
procedures to be used in developing the evidence, determine reasonable 
time periods for the conduct of the hearing, and designate the times and 
places for the production of witnesses for direct and cross-examination 
if leave to conduct oral examination is granted on any issue, as far as 
practicable at that time.



Sec.  12.92  Prehearing conference procedure.

    (a) Participants in a hearing are to appear at the prehearing 
conference prepared to discuss and resolve all matters specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section.
    (1) To expedite the hearing, participants are encouraged to prepare 
in advance for the prehearing conference. Participants should cooperate 
with each other, and request information and begin preparation of 
testimony at the earliest possible time. Failure of a participant to 
appear at the prehearing conference or to raise matters that could 
reasonably be anticipated and resolved at that time will not delay the 
progress of the hearing, and constitutes a waiver of the rights of the 
participant regarding such matters as objections to the agreements 
reached, actions taken, or rulings issued by the presiding officer and 
may be grounds for striking the participation under Sec.  12.45.
    (2) Participants shall bring to the prehearing conference the 
following specific information, which will be filed with the Division of 
Dockets Management under Sec.  12.80:
    (i) Any additional information to supplement the submission filed 
under Sec.  12.85, which may be filed if approved under Sec.  12.85(c).
    (ii) A list of all witnesses whose testimony will be offered, orally 
or in writing, at the hearing, with a full curriculum vitae for each. 
Additional witnesses may later be identified, with the approval of the 
presiding officer, on a showing that the witness was not reasonably 
available at the time of the prehearing conference or the relevance of 
the witness' views could not reasonably have been foreseen at that time.
    (iii) All prior written statements including articles and any 
written statement signed or adopted, or a recording or transcription of 
an oral statement made, by persons identified as witnesses if--
    (a) The statement is available without making request of the witness 
or any other person;
    (b) The statement relates to the subject matter of the witness' 
testimony; and

[[Page 187]]

    (c) The statement either was made before the time the person agreed 
to become a witness or has been made publicly available by the person.
    (b) The presiding officer will conduct a prehearing conference for 
the following purposes:
    (1) To determine the areas of factual disagreement to be considered 
at the hearing. The presiding officer may hold conferences off the 
record in an effort to reach agreement on disputed factual questions.
    (2) To identify the most appropriate techniques for developing 
evidence on issues in controversy and the manner and sequence in which 
they will be used, including, where oral examination is to be conducted, 
the sequence in which witnesses will be produced for, and the time and 
place of, oral examination. The presiding officer may consider--
    (i) Submission of narrative statements of position on factual issues 
in controversy;
    (ii) Submission of evidence or identification of previously 
submitted evidence to support such statements, such as affidavits, 
verified statements of fact, data, studies, and reports;
    (iii) Exchange of written interrogatories directed to particular 
witnesses;
    (iv) Written requests for the production of additional 
documentation, data, or other relevant information;
    (v) Submission of written questions to be asked by the presiding 
officer of a specific witness; and
    (vi) Identification of facts for which oral examination and/or 
cross-examination is appropriate.
    (3) To group participants with substantially like interests for 
presenting evidence, making motions and objections, including motions 
for summary decision, filing briefs, and presenting oral argument.
    (4) To hear and rule on objections to admitting into evidence 
information submitted under Sec.  12.85.
    (5) To obtain stipulations and admissions of facts.
    (6) To take other action that may expedite the hearing.
    (c) The presiding officer shall issue, orally or in writing, a 
prehearing order reciting the actions taken at the prehearing conference 
and setting forth the schedule for the hearing. The order will control 
the subsequent course of the hearing unless modified by the presiding 
officer for good cause.



Sec.  12.93  Summary decisions.

    (a) After the hearing commences, a participant may move, with or 
without supporting affidavits, for a summary decision on any issue in 
the hearing. Any other participant may, within 10 days after service of 
the motion, which time may be extended for an additional 10 days for 
good cause, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary 
decision. The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call 
for the submission of briefs.
    (b) The presiding officer will grant the motion if the objections, 
requests for hearing, other pleadings, affidavits, and other material 
filed in connection with the hearing, or matters officially noticed, 
show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that a 
participant is entitled to summary decision.
    (c) Affidavits should set forth facts that would be admissible in 
evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify 
to the matters stated. When a properly supported motion for summary 
decision is made, a participant opposing the motion may not rest upon 
mere allegations or denials or general descriptions of positions and 
contentions; affidavits or other responses must set forth specific facts 
showing that there is a genuine issue of fact for the hearing.
    (d) Should it appear from the affidavits of a participant opposing 
the motion that for sound reasons stated, facts essential to justify the 
opposition cannot be presented by affidavit, the presiding officer may 
deny the motion for summary decision, order a continuance to permit 
affidavits or additional evidence to be obtained, or issue other just 
order.
    (e) If on motion under this section a summary decision is not 
rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked. and 
evidentiary facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will issue 
an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial 
controversy

[[Page 188]]

and directing further evidentiary proceedings. The facts so specified 
will be deemed established.
    (f) A participant may obtain interlocutory review by the 
Commissioner of a summary decision of the presiding officer.



Sec.  12.94  Receipt of evidence.

    (a) A hearing consists of the development of evidence and the 
resolution of factual issues as set forth in this subpart and in the 
prehearing order.
    (b) All orders, transcripts, written statements of position, written 
direct testimony, written interrogatories and responses, and any other 
written material submitted in the proceeding is a part of the 
administrative record of the hearing, and will be promptly placed on 
public display in the office of the Division of Dockets Management, 
except as provided in Sec.  12.105.
    (c) Written evidence, identified as such, is admissible unless a 
participant objects and the presiding officer excludes it on objection 
of a participant or on the presiding officer's own initiative.
    (1) The presiding officer may exclude written evidence as 
inadmissible only if--
    (i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or 
repetitive;
    (ii) Exclusion of part or all of the written evidence of a 
participant is necessary to enforce the requirements of this subpart; or
    (iii) The evidence was not submitted as required by Sec.  12.85.
    (2) Items of written evidence are to be submitted as separate 
documents, sequentially numbered, except that a voluminous document may 
be submitted in the form of a cross-reference to the documents filed 
under Sec.  12.85.
    (3) Written evidence excluded by the presiding officer as 
inadmissible remains a part of the administrative record, as an offer of 
proof, for judicial review.
    (d) Testimony, whether on direct or on cross-examination, is 
admissible as evidence unless a participant objects and the presiding 
officer excludes it.
    (1) The presiding officer may exclude oral evidence as inadmissible 
only if--
    (i) The evidence is irrelevant, immaterial, unreliable, or 
repetitive; or
    (ii) Exclusion of part or all of the evidence is necessary to 
enforce the requirements of this part.
    (2) If oral evidence is excluded as inadmissible, the participant 
may take written exception to the ruling in a brief to the Commissioner, 
without taking oral exception at the hearing. Upon review, the 
Commissioner may reopen the hearing to permit the evidence to be 
admitted if the Commissioner determines that its exclusion was erroneous 
and prejudicial.
    (e) The presiding officer may schedule conferences as needed to 
monitor the program of the hearing, narrow and simplify the issues, and 
consider and rule on motions, requests, and other matters concerning the 
development of the evidence.
    (f) The presiding officer will conduct such proceedings as are 
necessary for the taking of oral testimony, for the oral examination of 
witnesses by the presiding officer on the basis of written questions 
previously submitted by the parties, and for the conduct of cross-
examination of witnesses by the parties. The presiding officer shall 
exclude irrelevant or repetitious written questions and limit oral 
cross-examination to prevent irrelevant or repetitious examination.
    (g) The presiding officer shall order the proceedings closed for the 
taking of oral testimony relating to matters specified in Sec.  
10.20(j)(2)(i) (a) and (b). Such closed proceedings will be conducted in 
accordance with Sec.  10.20(j)(3). Participation in closed proceedings 
will be limited to the witness, the witness' counsel, and Federal 
Government executive branch employees and special government employees.

oral testimony directly relating to matters specified in Sec.  
10.20(j)(3).



Sec.  12.95  Official notice.

    (a) Official notice may be taken of such matters as might be 
judicially noticed by the courts of the United States or of any other 
matter peculiarly within the general knowledge of FDA as an expert 
agency.

[[Page 189]]

    (b) If official notice is taken of a material fact not appearing in 
the evidence of record, a participant, on timely request, will be 
afforded an opportunity to show the contrary.



Sec.  12.96  Briefs and arguments.

    (a) Promptly after the taking of evidence is completed, the 
presiding officer will announce a schedule for the filing of briefs. 
Briefs are to be filed ordinarily within 45 days of the close of the

specific and complete citations to the evidence and points of law relied 
on. Briefs must contain proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law.
    (b) The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, permit 
oral argument after the briefs are filed.
    (c) Briefs and oral argument are to refrain from disclosing specific 
details of written and oral testimony and documents relating to matters

interlocutory appeal is specifically authorized by this subpart, rulings 
of the presiding officer may not be appealed to the Commissioner before 
the Commissioner's consideration of the entire record of the hearing.
    (b) A ruling of the presiding officer is subject to interlocutory 
appeal to the Commissioner if the presiding officer certifies on the 
record or in writing that immediate review is necessary to prevent 
exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice to any participant, or 
substantial harm to the public interest.
    (c) When an interlocutory appeal is made to the Commissioner, a 
participant may file a brief with the Commissioner only if specifically 
authorized by the presiding officer or the Commissioner, and if such 
authorization is granted, within the period the Commissioner directs. If 
a participant is authorized to file a brief, any other participant may 
file a brief in opposition, within the period the Commissioner directs. 
If no briefs are authorized, the appeal will be presented as an oral 
argument to the Commissioner. The oral argument will be transcribed. If 
briefs are authorized, oral argument will be heard only at the 
discretion of the Commissioner.

Sec.  13.1  Scope.

    The procedures in this part apply when--
    (a) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it 
is in the public interest to hold a public hearing before a Public Board 
of Inquiry (Board) with respect to any matter before FDA;
    (b) Under specific sections of this chapter a matter before FDA is 
subject to a hearing before a Board; or
    (c) Under Sec.  12.32, a person who has a right to an opportunity 
for a formal evidentiary public hearing waives that opportunity and 
requests that a Board act as an administrative law tribunal concerning 
the matters involved, and the Commissioner decides to accept this 
request.



Sec.  13.5  Notice of a hearing before a Board.

    If the Commissioner determines that a Board should be established to 
conduct a hearing on any matter, a notice of hearing will be published 
in the Federal Register setting forth the following information:
    (a) If the hearing is under Sec.  13.1 (a) or (b), all applicable 
information described in Sec.  12.32(e).
    (1) Any written document that is to be the subject matter of the 
hearing will be published as a part of the notice, or the notice will 
refer to it if the document has already been published in the Federal 
Register or state that the document is available from the Division of 
Dockets Management or an agency employee designated in the notice.
    (2) For purposes of a hearing under Sec.  13.1 (a) or (b), all 
participants who file a notice of participation under Sec.  
12.32(e)(6)(ii) are deemed to be parties and entitled to participate in 
selection of the Board under Sec.  13.15(b).
    (b) If the hearing is in lieu of a formal evidentiary hearing, as 
provided in Sec.  13.1(c), all of the information described in Sec.  
12.32(e).

[44 FR 22348, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 26375, June 18, 1982]



Sec.  13.10  Members of a Board.

    (a) All members of a Board are to have medical, technical, 
scientific, or other qualifications relevant to the issues to be 
considered, are subject to the conflict of interest rules applicable to 
special Government employees, and are to be free from bias or prejudice 
concerning the issues involved. A member of a Board may be a full-time 
or part-time Federal Government employee or may serve on an FDA advisory 
committee but, except with the agreement of all parties, may not 
currently be a full-time or part-time employee of FDA or otherwise act 
as a special Government employee of FDA.
    (b) Within 30 days of publication of the notice of hearing, the 
director of the center of FDA responsible for a

[[Page 193]]

matter before a Board, the other parties to the proceeding, and any 
person whose petition was granted and is the subject of the hearing, 
shall each submit to the Division of Dockets Management the names and 
full curricula vitae of five nominees for members of the Board. 
Nominations are to state that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is 
interested in becoming a member of the Board, and appears to have no 
conflict of interest.
    (1) Any two or more persons entitled to nominate members may agree 
upon a joint list of five qualified nominees.
    (2) The lists of nominees must be submitted to the persons entitled 
to submit a list of nominees under this paragraph but not to all 
participants. Within 10 days of receipt of the lists of nominees, such 
persons may submit comments to the Division of Dockets Management on 
whether the nominees of the other persons meet the criteria established 
in paragraph (a) of this section. A person submitting comments to the 
Division of Dockets Management shall submit them to all persons entitled 
to submit a list of nominees.
    (3) The lists of nominees and comments on them are to be held in 
confidence by the Division of Dockets Management as part of the 
administrative record of the proceeding and are not to be made available 
for public disclosure, and all persons who submit or receive them shall 
similarly hold them in confidence. This portion of the administrative 
record remains confidential but is available for judicial review in the 
event that it becomes relevant to any issue before a court.
    (c) After reviewing the lists of nominees and any comments, the 
Commissioner will choose three qualified persons as members of a Board. 
One member will be from the lists of nominees submitted by the director 
of the center and by any person whose petition was granted and is the 
subject of the hearing. The second will be from the lists of nominees 
submitted by the other parties. The Commissioner may choose the third 
member from any source. That member is the Chairman of the Board.
    (1) If the Commissioner is unable to find a qualified person with no 
conflict of interest from among a list of nominees or if additional 
information is needed, the Commissioner will request the submission of 
the required additional nominees or information.
    (2) If a person fails to submit a list of nominees as required by 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner may choose a qualified 
member without further consultation with that person.
    (3) The Commissioner will announce the members of a Board by filing 
a memorandum in the record of the proceeding and sending a copy to all 
participants.
    (d) Instead of using the selection method in paragraphs (b) and (c) 
of this section, the director of the center, the other parties to the 
proceeding, and any person whose petition was granted and is the subject 
of the hearing, may, with the approval of the Commissioner, agree that a 
standing advisory committee listed in Sec.  14.80 constitutes the Board 
for a particular proceeding, or that another procedure is to be used for 
selection of the members of the Board, or that the Board consists of a 
larger number of members.
    (e) The members of a Board serve as consultants to the Commissioner 
and are special Government employees or Government employees. A Board 
functions as an administrative law tribunal in the proceeding and is not 
an advisory committee subject to the requirements of the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act or part 14.
    (f) The Chairman of the Board has the authority of a presiding 
officer set out in Sec.  12.70.

[44 FR 22348, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 50 FR 8994, Mar. 6, 1985]



Sec.  13.15  Separation of functions; ex parte communications;
administrative support.

    (a) The proceeding of a Board are subject to the provisions of Sec.  
10.55 relating to separation of functions and ex parte communications. 
Representatives of the participants in any proceeding before a Board, 
including any members of the office of the Chief Counsel of FDA assigned 
to advise the center responsible for the matter, may have no contact 
with the members of the Board, except as participants in the proceeding, 
and may not participate in the deliberations of the Board.

[[Page 194]]

    (b) Administrative support for a Board is to be provided only by the 
office of the Commissioner and the office of the Chief Counsel for FDA.

                      Subpart B_Hearing Procedures



Sec.  13.20  Submissions to a Board.

    (a) Submissions are to be filed with the Division of Dockets 
Management under Sec.  10.20.
    (b) The person making a submission shall serve copies of it on each 
participant in the proceeding, except as provided in Sec. Sec.  
13.10(b)(2) and 13.45. Submissions of documentary data and information 
need not be sent to each participant, but any accompanying transmittal 
letter, summary, statement of position, certification under paragraph 
(d) of this section, or similar document must be.
    (c) A submission must be mailed to the address shown in the notice 
of appearance or personally delivered.
    (d) All submissions are to be accompanied by a certificate of 
service, or a statement that service is not required.
    (e) No written submission or other portion of the administrative 
record may be held in confidence, except as provided in Sec. Sec.  
13.10(b)(2) and 13.45.
    (f) A participant who believes that compliance with the requirements 
of this section constitutes an unreasonable financial burden may submit 
to the Commissioner a petition to participate in forma pauperis in the 
form and manner specified in Sec.  12.82.



Sec.  13.25  Disclosure of data and information by the participants.

    (a) Before the notice of hearing is published under Sec.  13.5, the 
director of the center responsible for the matters involved in the 
hearing must submit to the Division of Dockets Management--
    (1) The relevant portions of the existing administrative record of 
the proceeding. Portions of the administrative record not relevant to 
the issues in the hearing are not part of the administrative record;
    (2) A list of all persons whose views will be presented orally or in 
writing at the hearing;
    (3) All documents in the director's files containing factual 
information, whether favorable or unfavorable to the director's 
position, which relate to the issues involved in the hearing. Files 
means the principal files in the center in which documents relating to 
the issues in the hearing are ordinarily kept, e.g., the food additive 
master file and the food additive petition in the case of issues 
concerning a food additive, or the new drug application in the case of 
issues concerning a new drug. Internal memoranda reflecting the 
deliberative process, and attorney work product and material prepared 
specifically for use in connection with the hearing, are not required to 
be submitted;
    (4) All other documentary information relied on; and
    (5) A signed statement that, to the best of the director's knowledge 
and belief, the submission complies with this section.
    (b) Within the time prescribed in the notice of hearing published 
under Sec.  13.5, each participant shall submit to the Division of 
Dockets Management all information specified in paragraph (a)(2) through 
(5) of this section and any objections that the administrative record 
filed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section is incomplete. With respect 
to the information specified in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, 
participants are to exercise reasonable diligence in identifying 
documents in files comparable to those described in that paragraph.
    (c) The submissions required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of this 
section may be supplemented later in the proceeding, with the approval 
of the Board, on a showing that the views of the persons or the material 
contained in the supplement was not known or reasonably available when 
the initial submission was made or that the relevance of the views of 
the persons or the material contained in the supplement could not 
reasonably have been foreseen.
    (d) The failure to comply substantially and in good faith with this 
section in the case of a participant constitutes a waiver of the right 
to participate further in the hearing and in

[[Page 195]]

the case of a party constitutes a waiver of the right to a hearing.
    (e) The Chairman rules on questions relating to this section. Any 
participant dissatisfied with a ruling may petition the Commissioner for 
interlocutory review.

[44 FR 22348, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 50 FR 8994, Mar. 6, 1985; 54 
FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989]



Sec.  13.30  Proceedings of a Board.

    (a) The purpose of a Board is to review medical, scientific, and 
technical issues fairly and expeditiously. The proceedings of a Board 
are conducted as a scientific inquiry rather than a legal trial.
    (b) A Board may not hold its first hearing until after all 
participants have submitted the information required by Sec.  13.25.
    (c) The Chairman calls the first hearing of the Board. Notice of the 
time and location of the first hearing is to be published at least 15 
days in advance and the hearing will be open to the public. All 
participants will have an opportunity at the first hearing to make an 
oral presentation of the information and views which in their opinion 
are pertinent to the resolution of the issues being considered by a 
Board. A participant's presentation may be made by more than one person. 
The Chairman determines the order of the presentation. Participants may 
not interrupt a presentation, but members of the Board may ask 
questions. At the conclusion of a presentation, each of the other 
participants may briefly comment on the presentation and may request 
that the Board conduct further questioning on specified matters. Members 
of the Board may then ask further questions. Any other participant may 
be permitted to ask questions if the Chairman determines that it will 
help resolve the issues.
    (d) The hearing is informal and the rules of evidence do not apply. 
No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information 
and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment 
upon or rebut all such information and views. No participant may 
interrupt the presentation of another participant for any reason.
    (e) Within the time specified by the Board after its first hearing, 
participants may submit written rebuttal information and views in 
accordance with Sec.  13.20. The Chariman will then schedule a second 
hearing, if requested and justified by a participant. A second hearing, 
and any subsequent hearing, will be called only if the Chairman 
concludes that it is needed to fully and fairly present information that 
cannot otherwise adequately be considered and to properly resolve the 
issues. Notice of the time and location of any hearing is to be 
published at least 15 days in advance. The hearing is open to the 
public.
    (f) A Board may consult with any person who it concludes may have 
information or views relevant to the issues.
    (1) The consultation may occur only at an announced hearing of a 
Board. Participants have the right to suggest or, with the permission of 
the Chairman, ask questions of the consultant and present rebuttal 
information and views, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this 
section except that written statements may be submitted to the Board 
with the consent of all participants.
    (2) A participant may submit a request that the Board consult with a 
specific person who may have information or views relevant to the 
issues. The request will state why the person should be consulted and 
why the person's views cannot be furnished to the Board by means other 
than having FDA arrange for the person's appearance. The Board may, in 
its discretion, grant or deny the request.
    (g) All hearings are to be transcribed. All hearings are open to the 
public, except that a hearing under Sec.  10.20(j)(3) is closed to all 
persons except those persons making and participating in the 
presentation and Federal Government executive branch employees and 
special Government employees. At least a majority of Board members are 
to be present at every hearing. The executive sessions of a Board, 
during which a Board deliberates on the issues, are to be closed and are 
not transcribed. All members of the Board shall vote on the report of 
the Board.

[[Page 196]]

    (h) All legal questions are to be referred to the Chief counsel for 
FDA for resolution. The Chief Counsel's advice on any matter of 
procedure or legal authority is to be transmitted in writing and made a 
part of the record or presented in open session and transcribed.
    (i) At the conclusion of all public hearings the Board will announce 
that the record is closed to receiving information. The Board will 
provide an opportunity for participants to submit written statements of 
their positions, with proposed findings and conclusions, and may in its 
discretion, provide an opportunity for participants to summarize their 
positions orally.
    (j) The Board will prepare a decision on all issues. The decision is 
to include specific findings and references supporting and explaining 
the Board's conclusions, and a detailed statement of the reasoning on 
which the conclusions are based. Any member of the Board may file a 
separate report stating additional or dissenting views.

    (c) The Board may, in its discretion, reopen the record to receive 
further evidence at any time before filing an initial decision.



Sec.  13.45  Examination of administrative record.

    (a) The availability for public examination and copying of each 
document which is a part of the administrative record of the hearing is

examination or copying is placed on public display in the office of the 
Division of Dockets Management promptly upon receipt in that office.
    (b) Lists of nominees and comments submitted on them under Sec.  
13.10(b)(3) are not subject to disclosure unless they become an issue in 
a court proceeding.



Sec.  13.50  Record for administrative decision.

    The administrative record of the hearing specified in Sec.  13.40(a) 
constitutes the exclusive record for decision.

                      Subpart A_General Provisions



Sec.  14.1  Scope.

    (a) This part governs the procedures when any of the following 
applies:
    (1) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it 
is in the public interest for a standing or ad hoc policy or technical 
public advisory committee (advisory committee or committee) to hold a 
public hearing and to review and make recommendations on any matter 
before FDA and for interested persons to present information and views 
at an oral public hearing before the advisory committee.
    (2) Under specific provisions in the FD&C Act or other sections of 
this chapter, a matter is subject to a hearing before an advisory 
committee. The specific provisions are--
    (i) Section 14.120 on review of a performance standard for an 
electronic product by the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety 
Standards Committee (TEPRSSC);
    (ii) Section 14.140 on review of the safety of color additives;
    (iii) Section 14.160 on review of the safety and effectiveness of 
human prescription drugs;
    (iv) Section 330.10 on review of the safety and effectiveness of 
over-the-counter drugs;
    (v) Section 601.25 on review of the safety and effectiveness of 
biological drugs;
    (vi) Part 860, on classification of devices;

[[Page 198]]

    (vii) Section 514(b)(5) of the FD&C Act on establishment, amendment, 
or revocation of a device performance standard;
    (viii) Section 515 of the FD&C Act on review of device premarket 
approval applications and product development protocols; and
    (ix) Section 520(f) of the FD&C Act on review of device good 
manufacturing practice regulations.
    (3) A person who has a right to an opportunity for a formal 
evidentiary public hearing under part 12 waives that opportunity and 
instead under Sec.  12.32 requests a hearing before an advisory 
committee, and the Commissioner, as a matter of discretion, accepts the 
request.
    (b) In determining whether a group is a public advisory committee as 
defined in Sec.  10.3(a) and thus subject to this part and to the 
Federal advisory Committee Act, the following guidelines will be used:
    (1) An advisory committee may be a standing advisory committee or an 
ad hoc advisory committee. All standing advisory committees are listed 
in Sec.  14.100.
    (2) An advisory committee may be a policy advisory committee or a 
technical advisory committee. A policy advisory committee advises on 
broad and general matters. A technical advisory committee advises on 
specific technical or scientific issues, which may relate to regulatory 
decisions before FDA.
    (3) An advisory committee includes any of its subgroups when the 
subgroup is working on behalf of the committee. Section 14.40(d) 
describes when a subgroup will be established as an advisory committee 
separate from the parent committee.
    (4) A committee composed entirely of full-time Federal Government 
employees is not an advisory committee.
    (5) An advisory committee ordinarily has a fixed membership, a 
defined purpose of providing advice to the agency on a particular 
subject, regular or periodic meetings, and an organizational structure, 
for example, a Chairperson and staff, and serves as a source of 
independent expertise and advice rather than as a representative of or 
advocate for any particular interest. The following groups are not 
advisory committees:
    (i) A group of persons convened on an ad hoc basis to discuss a 
matter of current interest to FDA, but which has no continuing function 
or organization and does not involve substantial special preparation.
    (ii) A group of two or more FDA consultants meeting with the agency 
on an ad hoc basis.
    (iii) A group of experts who are employed by a private company or a 
trade association which has been requested by FDA to provide its views 
on a regulatory matter pending before FDA.
    (iv) A consulting firm hired by FDA to provide advice regarding a 
matter.
    (6) An advisory committee that is utilized by FDA is subject to this 
subpart even though it was not established by FDA. In general, a 
committee is utilized when FDA requests advice or recommendations from 
the committee on a specific matter in order to obtain an independent 
review and consideration of the matter, and not when FDA is merely 
seeking the comments of all interested persons or of persons who have a 
specific interest in the matter.
    (i) A committee formed by an independent scientific or technical 
organization is utilized if FDA requests advice of that committee rather 
than of the parent organization, or if the circumstances show that the 
advice given is that of the committee and not of the parent 
organization. A committee formed by an independent scientific or 
technical organization is not utilized if FDA requests advice of the 
organization rather than of a committee and if the recommendations of 
any committee formed in response to the request are subject to 
substantial independent policy and factual review by the governing body 
of the parent organization.
    (ii) A committee is not utilized by FDA if it provides only 
information, as contrasted with advice or opinions or recommendations.
    (iii) FDA is charged with seeking out the views of all segments of 
the public on enforcement of the laws administered by the Commissioner. 
The fact that a group of individuals or a committee meets regularly with 
FDA, for

[[Page 199]]

example, a monthly meeting with consumer representatives, does not make 
that group or committee an advisory committee. Thus, this subpart does 
not apply to routine meetings, discussions, and other dealings, 
including exchanges of views, between FDA and any committee representing 
or advocating the particular interests of consumers, industry, 
professional organizations, or others.
    (7) The inclusion of one or two FDA consultants who are special 
Government employees on an internal FDA committee does not make that 
committee an advisory committee.
    (8) A Public Board of Inquiry established under part 13, or other 
similar group convened by agreement between the parties to a regulatory 
proceeding pending before FDA to review and prepare an initial decision 
on the issues in lieu of a formal evidentiary public hearing, is acting 
as an administrative law tribunal and is not an advisory committee.
    (9) An open public conference or meeting conducted under Sec.  
10.65(b) is not an advisory committee meeting.
    (10) An FDA committee that primarily has operational responsibility 
rather than that of providing advice and recommendations is not an 
advisory committee, for example, the Research Involving Human Subjects 
Committee (RIHSC).
    (c) This part applies only when a committee convenes to conduct 
committee business. Site visits, social gatherings, informal discussions 
by telephone or during meals or while traveling or at other professional 
functions, or other similar activities do not constitute a meeting.
    (d) An advisory committee that is utilized but not established by 
FDA is subject to this part only to the extent of such utilization, and 
not concerning any other activities of such committee.
    (e) Any conference or meeting between an employee of FDA and a 
committee or group which is not an advisory committee shall be subject 
to Sec.  10.65 or other provisions specifically applicable to the 
committee or group, for example, part 13 for a Public Board of Inquiry.
    (f) This part applies to all FDA advisory committees, except to the 
extent that specific statutes require otherwise for a particular 
committee, for example, TEPRSSC and advisory committees established 
under the Medical Device Amendments of 1976.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 78 
FR 17087, Mar. 20, 2013]



Sec.  14.5  Purpose of proceedings before an advisory committee.

    (a) An advisory committee is utilized to conduct public hearings on 
matters of importance that come before FDA, to review the issues 
involved, and to provide advice and recommendations to the Commissioner.
    (b) The Commissioner has sole discretion concerning action to be 
taken and policy to be expressed on any matter considered by an advisory 
committee.



Sec.  14.7  Administrative remedies.

    A person who alleges noncompliance by the Commissioner or an 
advisory committee with any provision of this part or the Federal 
Advisory Committee Act may pursue the following administrative remedies:
    (a) If the person objects to any action, including a failure to act, 
other than denial of access to an advisory committee document, the 
person shall submit a petition in the form and in accordance with the 
requirements of Sec.  10.30. The provisions of Sec.  10.45 relating to 
exhaustion of administrative remedies are applicable.
    (1) If the person objects to past action, the person shall submit 
the petition within 30 days after the action objected to. If the 
Commissioner determines that there was noncompliance with any provision 
of this subpart or of the Federal Advisory Committee Act, the 
Commissioner will grant any appropriate relief and take appropriate 
steps to prevent its future recurrence.
    (2) If the person objects to proposed future action, the 
Commissioner will expedite the review of the petition and make a 
reasonable effort to render a decision before the action concerned in 
the petition.
    (3) If the person objects to action that is imminent or occurring 
and which could not reasonably have been anticipated, e.g., the closing 
of a portion of a meeting which is made known

[[Page 200]]

for the first time on the day of the meeting, the matter may be handled 
by an oral petition in lieu of a written petition.
    (b) If the person objects to a denial of access to an advisory 
committee document, administrative review is in accordance with the 
procedures established by the Department of Health and Human Services 
under 45 CFR 5.34.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 55 FR 1404, Jan. 16, 1990]



Sec.  14.10  Applicability to Congress.

    This part applies to Congress, individual Members of Congress, and 
other employees or representatives of Congress in the same way that they 
apply to any other member of the public, except that disclosure of 
advisory committee records to Congress is governed by Sec.  20.87.



Sec.  14.15  Committees working under a contract with FDA.

    (a) FDA may enter into contracts with independent scientific or 
technical organizations to obtain advice and recommendations on 
particular matters, and these organizations may in turn undertake such 
work through existing or new committees. Whether a particular committee 
working under such a contract is an advisory committee subject to the 
Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart depends upon application 
of the criteria and principles in Sec.  14.1(b).
    (b) The following minimum standards apply to any committee of an 
independent scientific or technical organization which is working under 
a contract initially executed with FDA after July 1, 1975, but which is 
determined not to be an advisory committee:
    (1) The committee shall give public notice of its meetings and 
agenda, and provide interested persons an opportunity to submit relevant 
information and views in writing at any time, and orally at specified 
times. The notice may be published in the Federal Register or 
disseminated by other reasonable means. It is in any event to be filed 
with the Division of Dockets Management not less than 15 days before the 
meeting. The time for oral presentations and the extent to which the 
committee meets in open session other than for such oral presentations 
is in the discretion of the committee.
    (2) Minutes of open sessions are to be maintained, with all written 
submissions attached which were made to the committee in open session. 
After approval, the minutes are to be forwarded to the Division of 
Dockets Management and placed on public display. The extent to which the 
committee maintains minutes of closed sessions is in the discretion of 
the committee.
    (3) In selecting the members of the committee, the organization 
involved is to apply the principles relating to conflicts of interest 
that FDA uses in establishing a public advisory committee. Those 
principles are set out or cross-referenced in this part and in part 19. 
Upon request, FDA will assist or provide guidance to any organization in 
meeting this requirement.



                      Subpart B_Meeting Procedures



Sec.  14.20  Notice of hearing before an advisory committee.

    (a) Before the first of each month, and at least 15 days in advance 
of a meeting, the Commissioner will publish a notice in the Federal 
Register of all advisory committee meetings to be held during the month. 
Any advisory committee meetings for that month called after the 
publication of the general monthly notice are to be announced in the 
Federal Register on an individual basis at least 15 days in advance. The 
Commissioner may authorize an exception to these notice requirements in 
an emergency or for other reasons requiring an immediate meeting of an 
advisory committee, in which case public notice will be given at the 
earliest time and in the most accessible form feasible including, 
whenever possible, publication in the Federal Register.
    (b) The Federal Register notice will include--
    (1) The name of the committee;
    (2) The date, time, and place of the meeting;
    (3) The general function of the committee;
    (4) A list of all agenda items, showing whether each will be 
discussed in an open or closed portion of the meeting;

[[Page 201]]

    (5) If any portion of the meeting is closed, a statement of the time 
of the open and closed portions;
    (6) The nature of the subjects to be discussed during, and the 
reasons for closing, any closed portion of the meeting;
    (7) The time set aside for oral statements and other public 
participation;
    (8) The name, address, and telephone number of the advisory 
committee Designated Federal Officer and any other agency employee 
designated as responsible for the administrative support for the 
advisory committee;
    (9) A statement that written submissions may be made to the advisory 
committee through the Designated Federal Officer at any time, unless a 
cutoff date has been established under Sec.  14.35(d)(2);
    (10) When a notice is published in the Federal Register less than 15 
days before a meeting, an explanation for the lateness of the notice; 
and
    (c) If a public hearing before an advisory committee is used in lieu 
of a formal evidentiary public hearing under Sec.  14.1(a)(3), an 
initial notice of hearing is to be published separately in the Federal 
Register containing all the information described in Sec.  12.32(e). 
This procedure may be used for any other hearing before an advisory 
committee when the Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, 
that it would be informative to the public.
    (d) A list of advisory committee meetings will be distributed to the 
press by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 26375, June 1, 1982; 54 
FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 66 FR 6469, Jan. 22, 2001; 66 FR 12850, Mar. 1, 
2001]



Sec.  14.22  Meetings of an advisory committee.

    (a) No advisory committee may conduct a meeting except at the call 
or with the advance approval of, and with an agenda approved by, the 
designated Federal employee or alternate. No meeting may be held in the 
absence of the designated Federal employee.
    (1) If any matter is added to the agenda after its publication in 
the Federal Register under Sec.  14.20(b)(4), an attempt is to be made 
to inform persons known to be interested in the matter, and the change 
is to be announced at the beginning of the open portion of the meeting.
    (2) The advisory committee meeting is to be conducted in accordance 
with the approved final agenda insofar as practical.
    (b) Advisory committee meetings will be held at places that are 
reasonably accessible to the public. All advisory committee meetings 
will be held in Washington, DC, or Rockville, MD, or the immediate 
vicinity, unless the Commissioner receives and approves a written 
request from the advisory committee for a different location. A 
different location may be approved when one or more of the following 
applies:
    (1) The total cost of the meeting to the Government will be reduced.
    (2) A substantial number of the committee members will be at the 
location at no expense to FDA for other reasons, e.g., for a meeting of 
a professional association.
    (3) It is a central location more readily accessible to committee 
members.
    (4) There is a need for increased participation available at that 
location.
    (5) The committee wishes to review work or facilities in a specific 
location.
    (6) The committee is concerned with matters that functionally or 
historically occur in some other location, e.g., the Science Advisory 
Board of the National Center for Toxicological Research will generally 
hold meetings in the Little Rock, AR, vicinity.
    (c) Advisory committee members may, with the approval of FDA, 
conduct onsite visits relevant to their work.
    (d) Unless the committee charter provides otherwise, a quorum for an 
advisory committee is a majority of the current voting members of the 
committee, except as provided in Sec.  14.125(c) for TEPRSSC. Any matter 
before the advisory committee is to be decided by a majority vote of the 
voting members present at the time, except that the designated Federal 
official may require that any final report be voted upon by all current 
voting members of the committee. Any current voting member of the 
committee may file a separate report with additional or minority views.

[[Page 202]]

    (e) If space is available, any interested person may attend any 
portion of any advisory committee meeting which is not closed.
    (f) Whenever feasible, meetings are to be held in government 
facilities or other facilities involving the least expense to the 
public. The size of the meeting room is to be reasonable, considering 
such factors as the size of the committee, the number of persons 
expected to attend a meeting, and the resources and facilities 
available.
    (g) The Commissioner may authorize a meeting to be held by 
conference telephone call. For these meetings, a speaker phone will be 
provided in a conference room located in Washington, DC, or Rockville, 
MD, or the immediate vicinity, to permit public participation in open 
portions of the meetings, as provided in Sec. Sec.  14.25 and 14.29. 
These meetings generally will be brief, and authorized--
    (1) For the purpose of taking final votes or otherwise confirming 
actions taken by the committee at other meetings; or
    (2) Where time does not permit a meeting to be held at a central 
location.
    (h) Any portion of a meeting will be closed by the committee 
Chairperson only when matters are to be discussed which the Commissioner 
has determined may be considered in closed session under Sec.  14.27(b). 
If a portion of the meeting is closed, the closed portion will be held 
after the conclusion of the open portion whenever practicable.
    (i) Any committee member may take notes during meetings and report 
and discuss committee deliberations after a meeting is completed and 
before official minutes or a report are available, within the rules and 
regulations adopted by FDA and by the advisory committee with the 
concurrence of FDA, including all of the following:
    (1) There may be no attribution of individual views expressed in a 
closed session or revealing of numerical votes.
    (2) There may be no reporting or discussion of any particular matter 
if the committee or FDA specifically so directs, e.g., where 
deliberations are incomplete or involve a sensitive regulatory decision 
that requires preparation or implementation.
    (3) There may be no reporting or discussion of information 
prohibited from public disclosure under Sec.  14.75.
    (4) Notes or minutes kept or reports prepared by a committee member 
have no status or effect unless adopted into the official minutes or 
report by the committee.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979; 48 FR 40887, Sept. 12, 1983, as amended at 
54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989; 78 FR 17087, Mar. 20, 2013]



Sec.  14.25  Portions of advisory committee meetings.

    An advisory committee meeting has the following portions:
    (a) The open public hearing. Every committee meeting includes an 
open portion, which constitutes a public hearing during which interested 
persons may present relevant information or views orally or in writing. 
The hearing is conducted in accordance with Sec.  14.29.
    (b) The open committee discussion. A committee discusses any matter 
pending before it in an open portion of its meeting unless the meeting 
has been closed for that matter under Sec.  14.27. To the maximum extent 
feasible, consistent with the policy expressed in Sec.  14.27, a 
committee conducts its discussion of pending matters in an open portion. 
No public participation is permissible during this portion of the 
meeting except with the consent of the committee Chairperson.
    (c) The closed presentation of data. Information prohibited from 
public disclosure under part 20 and the regulations referenced therein 
is presented to the committee in a closed portion of its meeting. 
However, if information is in the form of a summary that is not 
prohibited from public disclosure, the presentation is to be made in an 
open portion of a meeting.
    (d) The closed committee deliberations. Deliberations about matters 
before an advisory committee may be held in a closed portion of a 
meeting only upon an appropriate determination by the Commissioner under 
Sec.  14.27.



Sec.  14.27  Determination to close portions of advisory committee
meetings.

    (a) No committee meeting may be entirely closed. A portion of a 
meeting may be closed only in accordance with

[[Page 203]]

a written determination by the Commissioner under this section.
    (b) The Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency 
employee shall prepare the initial request for a determination to close 
a portion of a meeting, specifying the matter(s) to be discussed during 
the closed portion and the reasons why the portion should be closed. The 
Commissioner, based upon this request and with the concurrence of the 
Chief Counsel, will determine whether to close a portion of a meeting. 
The reasons for closing a portion of a meeting will be announced in the 
Federal Register notice of the meeting under Sec.  14.20 in accordance 
with the following rules:
    (1) Any determination to close a portion of a meeting restricts the 
closing to the shortest possible time consistent with the policy in this 
section.
    (2) A portion of a meeting may be closed only if the Commissioner 
determines that the closing is permitted under 5 U.S.C. 552b(c), and 
that the closing is necessary.
    (3) Portions of meetings may ordinarily be closed if they concern 
the review, discussion, and evaluation of drafts or regulations, 
guidance documents or similar preexisting internal agency documents, but 
only if their premature disclosure would significantly impede proposed 
agency action; review of trade secrets and confidential commercial or 
financial information; consideration of matters involving investigatory 
files compiled for law enforcement purposes; and review of matters, the 
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy.
    (4) Portions of meetings ordinarily may not be closed if they 
concern review, discussion, and evaluation of general preclinical and 
clinical test protocols and procedures for a class of drugs or devices; 
consideration of labeling requirements for a class of marketed drugs and 
devices; review of information on specific investigational or marketed 
drugs and devices that have previously been made public; presentation of 
any other information not exempt from public disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 
552b(c); the formulation of advice and recommendations to FDA on matters 
that do not independently justify closing.
    (5) No portion of a meeting devoted to matters other than those 
designated in paragraph (b) (1) through (3) of this section may be 
closed.
    (6) A matter which is properly considered in an open portion of a 
meeting may instead be considered in a closed portion only if it is so 
inextricably intertwined with matters to be discussed in a closed 
portion that it is not feasible to separate them or discussion of the 
matter in an open portion would compromise the matters to be discussed 
in the closed portion.
    (c) Attendance at a closed portion of a meeting is governed by the 
following rules:
    (1) A portion of a meeting closed for the presentation or discussion 
of information that constitutes a trade secret or confidential 
commercial or financial information as defined in Sec.  20.61 may be 
attended only by voting advisory committee members, nonvoting members 
representing consumer interests who are also special government 
employees as provided in Sec.  14.80(b), the Designated Federal Officer 
of the advisory committee, a transcriber, consultants, and such other 
regular employees of FDA (including members of the Office of the Chief 
Counsel) as the Chairperson of the advisory committee may invite, and by 
those persons authorized to be present under Sec.  14.25(c), for 
presentation of information prohibited from public disclosure. A person 
making a presentation described in Sec.  14.25(c) may be accompanied by 
a reasonable number of employees, consultants, or other persons in a 
commercial arrangement within the meaning of Sec.  20.81(a).
    (2) A portion of a meeting that has been closed for consideration of 
existing internal agency documents falling within Sec.  20.62 where 
premature disclosure is likely to significantly impede proposed agency 
action; personnel, medical, and similar files, disclosure of which would 
be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy within the meaning 
of Sec.  20.63; or investigatory records compiled for law enforcement 
purposes as defined in Sec.  20.64 may be attended only by committee 
members (voting and nonvoting), the Designated Federal Officer of the 
committee, a

[[Page 204]]

transcriber, and other regular employees of FDA (including members of 
the Office of the Chief Counsel) whom the Chairperson of the committee 
may invite. Consultants, individuals performing personal service 
contracts, employees of other Federal agencies, and the general public 
may not attend such portions.
    (3) If a person other than a person permitted to attend in 
accordance with paragraph (c) (1) and (2) of this section attempts to 
attend a closed portion of a meeting without the approval of the 
Designated Federal Officer and the Chairperson, and the matter is 
brought to their attention, the person will be required to leave the 
meeting immediately. This inadvertent and unauthorized attendance does 
not enable other unauthorized persons to attend, nor does it, of itself, 
constitute grounds for release of transcripts of closed portions or any 
other documents otherwise exempt from disclosure under Sec.  14.75 and 
part 20.
    (4) If a person other than a person permitted to attend in 
accordance with paragraphs (c) (1) and (2) of this section is allowed by 
the Designated Federal Officer and the Chairperson to attend a closed 
portion of a meeting, that portion is open to attendance by any 
interested person.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 65 FR 56479, Sept. 19, 2000]



Sec.  14.29  Conduct of a hearing before an advisory committee.

    (a) For each meeting, the open portion for public participation, 
which constitutes a public hearing under Sec.  14.25(a), will be at 
least 1 hour, unless public participation does not last that long, and 
may last for whatever longer time the committee Chairperson determines 
will facilitate the work of the committee. The Federal Register notice 
published under Sec.  14.20 will designate the time specifically 
reserved for the hearing, which is ordinarily the first portion of the 
meeting. Further public participation in any open portion of the meeting 
under Sec.  14.25(b) is solely at the discretion of the Chairperson.
    (b) An interested person who wishes to be assured of the right to 
make an oral presentation at a meeting shall inform the Designated 
Federal Officer or other designated agency employee, orally or in 
writing, before the meeting.
    (1) The person shall state the general nature of the presentation 
and the approximate time desired. Whenever possible, all written 
information to be discussed by that person at the meeting should be 
furnished in advance to the Designated Federal Officer or other 
designated agency employee. This material may be distributed or mailed 
by FDA to the committee members in advance of the meeting if time 
permits, and otherwise will be distributed to the members when they 
arrive for the meeting. The mailing or distribution may be undertaken 
only by FDA unless FDA grants permission to a person to mail or 
distribute the material
    (2) Before the meeting, the Designated Federal Officer or other 
designated agency employee shall determine the amount of time allocated 
to each person for oral presentation and the time that the presentation 
is to begin. Each person will be so informed in writing, if time 
permits, or by telephone. FDA may require persons with common interests 
to make joint presentations.
    (c) The Chairperson of the committee shall preside at the meeting in 
accordance with Sec.  14.30 and be accompanied by other committee 
members, who serve as a panel in conducting the hearing portion of the 
meeting.
    (d) Each person may use the allotted time as desired, consistent 
with an orderly hearing. A person may be accompanied by additional 
persons, and may present any written information or views for inclusion 
in the record of the hearing, subject to the requirements of Sec.  
14.35(c).
    (e) If a person is absent at the time specified for that person's 
presentation, the persons following will appear in order. An attempt 
will be made to hear the person at the conclusion of the hearing. 
Interested persons attending the hearing who did not request an 
opportunity to make an oral presentation may be given an opportunity to 
do so at the discretion of the Chairperson.
    (f) The Chairperson and other members may question a person 
concerning

[[Page 205]]

that person's presentation. No other person, however, may question the 
person. The Chairperson may allot additional time when it is in the 
public interest, but may not reduce the time allotted without consent of 
the person.
    (g) Participants may question a committee member only with that 
member's permission and only about matters before the committee.
    (h) The hearing is informal, and the rules of evidence do not apply. 
No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of information 
and views may be made or considered, but other participants may comment 
upon or rebut matters presented. No participant may interrupt the 
presentation of another participant.



Sec.  14.30  Chairperson of an advisory committee.

    (a) The advisory committee Chairperson has the authority to conduct 
hearings and meetings, including the authority to adjourn a hearing or 
meeting if the Chairperson determines that adjournment is in the public 
interest, to discontinue discussion of a matter, to conclude the open 
portion of a meeting, or to take any other action to further a fair and 
expeditious hearing or meeting.
    (b) If the Chairperson is not a full-time employee of FDA, the 
Designated Federal Officer or other designated agency employee, or 
alternate, is to be the designated Federal employee who is assigned to 
the advisory committee. The designated Federal employee is also 
authorized to adjourn a hearing or meeting if the employee determines 
adjournment to be in the public interest.



Sec.  14.31  Consultation by an advisory committee with other persons.

    (a) A committee may confer with any person who may have information 
or views relevant to any matter pending before the committee.
    (b) An interested person may submit to the committee a written 
request that it confer with specific persons about any matter pending 
before the committee. The request is to contain adequate justification. 
The committee may, in its discretion, grant the request.
    (c) A committee may confer with a person who is not a Federal 
Government executive branch employee only during the open portions of a 
meeting. The person may, however, submit views in writing to the 
committee as part of the administrative record under Sec.  14.70. The 
person may participate at the closed portions of a meeting only if 
appointed as a special Government employee by the Commissioner as 
provided in paragraph (e) of this section. This paragraph (c) is not 
intended to bar the testimony of a person during a closed portion of a 
meeting about matters prohibited from public disclosure under Sec. Sec.  
14.25(c) and 14.27(c).
    (d) To prevent inadvertent violation of Federal conflict of interest 
laws and laws prohibiting disclosure of trade secrets (18 U.S.C. 208, 21 
U.S.C. 331(j), 18 U.S.C. 1905), Federal executive branch employees who 
are not employees of the Department may not confer, testify, or 
otherwise participate (other than as observers) at any portion of an 
advisory committee meeting unless they are appointed as special 
Government employees by the Commissioner under paragraph (e) of this 
section. this paragraph does not apply to Federal executive branch 
employees who are appointed as members of TEPRSSC, as provided in Sec.  
14.127.
    (e) The Commissioner may appoint persons as special Government 
employees to be consultants to an advisory committee. Consultants may be 
appointed to provide expertise, generally concerning a highly technical 
matter, not readily available from the members of the committee. 
Consultants may be either from outside the Government or from agencies 
other than the Food and Drug Administration. Reports, data, information, 
and other written submissions made to a public advisory committee by a 
consultant are part of the administrative record itemized in Sec.  
14.70.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 55 FR 42703, Oct. 23, 1990]



Sec.  14.33  Compilation of materials for members of an advisory committee.

    The Commissioner shall prepare and provide to all committee members 
a compilation of materials bearing upon

[[Page 206]]

members' duties and responsibilities, including--
    (a) All applicable conflict of interest laws and regulations and a 
summary of their principal provisions;
    (b) All applicable laws and regulations relating to trade secrets 
and confidential commercial or financial information that may not be 
disclosed publicly and a summary of their principal provisions;
    (c) All applicable laws, regulations, and guidance documents 
relating to the subject matter covered by the advisory committee and a 
summary of their principal provisions;
    (d) All applicable laws, regulations, including the regulations in 
part 20 of this chapter, advisory committee charters, Federal Register 
notices, curricula vitae, rules adopted by the advisory committee, and 
other material relating to the formation, composition, and operation of 
the advisory committee, and a summary of their principal provisions;
    (e) Instructions on whom to contact when questions arise; and
    (f) Other material relating to FDA and the subject matter covered by 
the committee which may facilitate the work of the committee.

[44 FR 22351, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 65 FR 56479, Sept. 19, 2000]



Sec.  14.35  Written submissions to an advisory committee.

    (a) Ten copies of written submissions to a committee are to be sent 
to the Designated Federal Officer unless an applicable Federal Register 
notice or other regulations in this chapter specify otherwise. 
Submissions are subject to the provisions of Sec.  10.20, except that it 
is not necessary to send copies to the Division of Dockets Management.
    (b) At the request of a committee, or on the Commissioner's own 
initiative, the Commissioner may issue in the Federal Register a notice 
requesting the submission to the committee of written information and 
views pertinent to a matter being reviewed by the committee. The notice 
may specify the manner in which the submission should be made.
    (c) At the request of a committee, or on the Commissioner's own 
initiative, the Commissioner may at any time request the applicant or 
sponsor of an application or petition about a specific product on which 
action is pending before FDA, and is being reviewed by an advisory 
committee, to present or discuss safety, effectiveness, or other data 
concerning the product during a regularly scheduled meeting of the 
committee. The request may be for an oral presentation or for a concise, 
well-organized written summary of pertinent information for review by 
the committee members before the meeting, or both. Unless specified 
otherwise, one copy of the written summary along with a proposed agenda 
outlining the topics to be covered and identifying the participating 
industry staff members or consultants that will present each topic is to 
be submitted to the Designated Federal Officer or other designated 
agency employee at least 3 weeks before the meeting.
    (d) An interested person may submit to a committee written 
information or views on any matter being reviewed. Voluminous data is to 
be accompanied by a summary. A submission is to be made to the 
Designated Federal Officer and not directly to a committee member.
    (1) FDA will distribute submissions to each member, either by mail 
or at the next meeting. Submissions will be considered by the committee 
in its review of the matter.
    (2) A committee may establish, and give public notice of, a cutoff 
date after which submissions about a matter will no longer be received 
or considered.
    (e) The Commissioner will provide the committee all information the 
Commissioner deems relevant. A member will, upon request, also be 
provided any material available to FDA which the member believes 
appropriate for an independent judgment on the matter, e.g., raw data 
underlying a summary or report, or a briefing on the legal aspects of 
the matter.



Sec.  14.39  Additional rules for a particular advisory committee.

    (a) In addition to these rules, an advisory committee may, with the 
concurrence of the designated Federal employee, adopt additional rules 
which

[[Page 207]]

are not inconsistent with this subpart or with other legal requirements.
    (b) Any additional rules will be included in the minutes of the 
meeting when adopted and in the materials compiled under Sec.  14.33 and 
will be available for public disclosure under Sec.  14.65(c).



             Subpart C_Establishment of Advisory Committees



Sec.  14.40  Establishment and renewal of advisory committees.

    (a) An advisory committee may be established or renewed whenever it 
is necessary or appropriate for the committee to hold a public hearing 
and to review and make recommendations on any matter pending before FDA. 
Except for committees established by statute, before a committee is 
established or renewed it must first be approved by the Department 
pursuant to 45 CFR part 11 and by the General Services Administration.
    (b) When an advisory committee is established or renewed, the 
Commissioner will issue a Federal Register notice certifying that the 
establishment or renewal is in the public interest and stating the 
structure, function, and purposes of the committee and, if it is a 
standing advisory committee, shall amend Sec.  14.100 to add it to the 
list of standing advisory committees. A notice of establishment will be 
published at least 15 days before the filing of the advisory committee 
charter under paragraph (c) of this section. A notice of renewal does 
not require the 15-day notice.
    (c) No committee may meet or take action until its charter is 
prepared and filed as required by section 9(c) of the Federal Advisory 
Committee Act. This requirement is to be met by an advisory committee 
utilized by FDA, even though it is not established by the agency, prior 
to utilization.
    (d) The regulations of the Department cited in paragraph (a) of this 
section provide that the charter of a parent committee may incorporate 
information concerning activities of a subgroup. In such instances, a 
subgroup will not be established as a committee distinct from the parent 
committee. However, a subgroup will be established as a separate 
committee when the charter of the parent committee does not incorporate 
the activities of the subgroup, or when the subgroup includes members 
who are not all drawn from the parent committee.
    (e) An advisory committee not required to be established by law will 
be established or utilized only if it is in the public interest and only 
if its functions cannot reasonably be performed by other existing 
advisory committees or by FDA.
    (f) An advisory committee must meet the following standards:
    (1) Its purpose is clearly defined.
    (2) Its membership is balanced fairly in terms of the points of view 
represented in light of the functions to be performed. Although 
proportional representation is not required, advisory committee members 
are selected without regard to race, color, national origin, religion, 
age, or sex.
    (3) It is constituted and utilizes procedures designed to assure 
that its advice and recommendations are the result of the advisory 
committee's independent judgment.
    (4) Its staff is adequate. The Commissioner designates an Designated 
Federal Officer and alternate for every advisory committee, who are 
employees of FDA. The Designated Federal Officer is responsible for all 
staff support unless other agency employees are designated for this 
function.
    (5) Whenever feasible, or required by statute, it includes 
representatives of the public interest.

Sec.  14.55  Termination of advisory committees.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a standing 
advisory committee is terminated when it is no longer needed, or not 
later than 2 years after its date of establishment unless it is renewed 
for an additional 2-year period. A committee may be renewed for as many 
2-year periods as the public interest requires. The requirements for 
establishment of a committee under Sec.  14.40 also apply to its 
renewal.
    (b) FDA will issue a Federal Register notice announcing the reasons 
for terminating a committee and, if it

[[Page 208]]

is a standing committee, amending Sec.  14.100 to delete it from the 
list.
    (c) TEPRSSC is a permanent statutory advisory committee established 
by section 358(f)(1)(A) of the Public Health Service Act, as added by 
the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968, transferred to 
the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360kk(f)(1)(A)), and is not subject to 
termination and renewal under paragraph (a) of this section, except that 
a new charter is prepared and filed at the end of each 2-year period as 
provided in Sec.  14.40(c). Also, the statutory medical device 
classification panels established under section 513(b)(1) of the FD&C 
Act (21 U.S.C. 360c(b)(1)) and part 860, and the statutory medical 
device good manufacturing practice advisory committees established under 
section 520(f)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 360j(f)(3)), are 
specifically exempted from the normal 2-year duration period.
    (d) Color additive advisory committees are required to be 
established under the circumstances specified in sections 721(b)(5)(C) 
and (D) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 379e(b)(5)(C) and (D)). A color 
additive advisory committee is subject to the termination and renewal 
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and of this part.
    (e) The Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee is a 
permanent statutory advisory committee established by section 917 of the 
Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (21 U.S.C. 387q) (Pub. 
L. 111-31) and is not subject to termination and renewal under paragraph 
(a) of this section.

                Subpart E_Members of Advisory Committees



Sec.  14.80  Qualifications for members of standing policy and
technical advisory committees.

    (a) Members of a policy advisory committee--
    (1) Shall have diverse interests, education, training, and 
experience; specific technical expertise is not a requirement;
    (2) Are subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations 
either as special Government employees or as members of the uniformed 
services, including the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service 
(the Commissioner has determined that, because members representing 
particular interests, e.g., a representative of labor, industry, 
consumers, or agriculture, are included on advisory committees 
specifically for the purpose of representing these interests, any 
financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in the class which the 
member represents

[[Page 211]]

is irrelevant to the services which the Government expects from them and 
thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 208(b) as too remote and 
inconsequential to affect the integrity of their services); and
    (3) Shall be voting members.
    (b) Technical advisory committee. (1) Voting members of technical 
advisory committees--
    (i) Shall have expertise in the subject matter with which the 
committee is concerned and have diverse professional education, 
training, and experience so that the committee will reflect a balanced 
composition of sufficient scientific expertise to handle the problems 
that come before it; and
    (ii) Except for members of the Technical Electronic Product 
Radiation Safety Standards Committee (TEPRSSC), are subject to the 
conflict of interest laws and regulations either as special Government 
employees or as members of the uniformed services, including the 
Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service.
    (2) The Commissioner shall, when required by statute, and may when 
not required by statute, provide for nonvoting members of a technical 
advisory committee to serve as representatives of and liaison with 
interested organizations. Nonvoting members--
    (i) Shall be selected by the interested organizations, as provided 
in Sec.  14.84; technical expertise in the subject matter with which the 
committee is involved is not a requirement; and
    (ii) May be special Government employees subject to the conflict of 
interest laws and regulations, except as provided in Sec.  14.84(e).
    (c) A person may serve as a voting or nonvoting member on only one 
FDA advisory committee unless the Commissioner determines in writing 
that dual membership will aid the work of the committees involved and is 
in the public interest.
    (d) Members of FDA advisory committees, and the Chairperson, are 
appointed from among those nominated under Sec. Sec.  14.82 and 14.84 
and from any other sources by the Secretary, or, by delegation of 
authority, by the Assistant Secretary for Health, or the Commissioner.
    (e) Members appointed to an advisory committee serve for the 
duration of the committee, or until their terms of appointment expire, 
they resign, or they are removed from membership by the Commissioner.
    (f) A committee member may be removed from membership for good 
cause. Good cause includes excessive absenteeism from committee 
meetings, a demonstrated bias that interferes with the ability to render 
objective advice, failure to abide by the procedures established in this 
subpart, or violation of other applicable rules and regulations, e.g., 
for nonvoting members, the provisions of Sec.  14.86(c).
    (g) Consultants appointed under Sec.  14.31(e) are not members of 
advisory committees.

54 FR 9035, Mar. 3, 1989]



Sec.  14.82  Nominations of voting members of standing advisory committees.

    (a) The Commissioner will publish one or more notices in the Federal 
Register each year requesting nominations for voting members of all 
existing standing advisory committees. The notice will invite the 
submission of nominations for voting members from both individuals and 
organizations.
    (b) The notice announcing the establishment of a new committee under 
Sec.  14.40(b) will invite the submission of nominations for voting 
members.
    (c) A person may nominate one or more qualified persons to an 
advisory committee. Nominations will specify the advisory committee for 
which the nominee is recommended and will include a complete curriculum 
vitae of the nominee. Nominations are to state that the nominee is aware 
of the nomination, is willing to serve as a member of the advisory 
committee, and appears to have no conflict of interest that would 
preclude membership.
    (d) Voting members serve as individuals and not as representatives 
of any group or organization which nominated them or with which they may 
be affiliated.

[[Page 212]]



Sec.  14.84  Nominations and selection of nonvoting members of 
standing technical advisory committees.

    (a) This section applies when the Commissioner concludes that a 
technical advisory committee should include nonvoting members to 
represent and serve as a liaison with interested individuals and 
organizations.
    (b) Except when the Commissioner concludes otherwise, nonvoting 
members of a technical advisory committee are selected in accordance 
with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section and are normally limited to 
one person selected by consumer groups and organizations and one person 
selected by industry groups and organizations.
    (c) To select a nonvoting member to represent consumer interests, 
except as provided in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, the Commissioner 
publishes a notice in the Federal Register requesting nominations for 
each specific committee, or subcommittee, for which nonvoting members 
are to be appointed.
    (1) A period of 30 days will be permitted for submission of 
nominations for that committee or subcommittee. Interested persons may 
nominate one or more qualified persons to represent consumer interests. 
Although nominations from individuals will be accepted, individuals are 
encouraged to submit their nominations through consumer organizations as 
defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Nominations of qualified 
persons for general consideration as nonvoting members of unspecified 
advisory committees or subcommittees may be made at any time. All 
nominations are to be submitted in writing to Advisory Committee 
Oversight and Management Staff, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New 
Hampshire Ave., Bldg. 32, rm. 1503, Silver Spring, MD 20993.
    (2) A complete curriculum vitae of any nominee is to be included. 
Nominations must state that the nominee is aware of the nomination, is 
willing to serve as a member of an advisory committee, and appears to 
have no conflict of interest. The nomination must state whether a 
nominee is interested only in a particular advisory committee or 
subcommittee, or whether the nominee is interested in becoming a member 
of any advisory committee or subcommittee. Nominations that do not 
comply with the requirements of this paragraph will not be considered.
    (3) The Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will 
compile a list of organizations whose objectives are to promote, 
encourage, and contribute to the advancement of consumer education and 
to the resolution of consumer problems. All organizations listed are 
entitled to vote upon the nominees. The list will include organizations 
representing the public interest, consumer advocacy groups, and 
consumer/health branches of Federal, State, and local governments. Any 
organization that meets the criteria may be included on such list on 
request.
    (4) The executive secretary, or other designated agency employee, 
will review the list of nominees and select three to five qualified 
nominees to be placed on a ballot. Names not selected will remain on a 
list of eligible nominees and be reviewed periodically by the Advisory 
Committee Oversight and Management Staff to determine continued 
interest. Upon selection of the nominees to be placed on the ballot, the 
curriculum vitae for each of the nominees will be sent to each of the 
organizations on the list complied under paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section, together with a ballot to be filled out and returned within 30 
days. After the time for return of the ballots has expired, the ballots 
will be counted and the nominee who has received the highest number of 
votes will be selected as the nonvoting member representing consumer 
interests for that particular advisory committee or subcommittee. In the 
event of a tie, the Commissioner will select the winner by lot from 
among those tied for the highest number of votes
    (5) If a member representing consumer interests resigns or is 
removed before termination of the committee on which the member is 
serving, the following procedures will be used to appoint a replacement 
to serve out the term of the former member:
    (i) The Commissioner will appoint the runner-up, in order of number 
of ballots received, on the original ballot submitted under paragraph 
(c)(4) of this section to fill the vacancy. If the

[[Page 213]]

runner-up is no longer willing to serve as a member, then the next 
runner-up will be appointed.
    (ii) If none of the nominees on the original ballot is willing to 
serve, or if there was only one nominee on the original ballot, the 
Advisory Committee Oversight and Management Staff will contact by 
telephone eligible individuals whose names have been submitted in the 
past as candidates for membership as representatives of consumer 
interests. A list of persons who are interested in serving on an 
advisory committee will then be prepared. The curricula vitae of these 
persons, together with a ballot, will be sent to a representative number 
of consumer organizations that have been determined to be eligible to 
vote for consumer representatives in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of 
this section. After 4 days have elapsed, the Advisory Committee 
Oversight and Management Staff will contact the consumer organizations 
by telephone and elicit their votes. The candidate who has received the 
highest number of votes will be selected. In the event of a tie, the 
Commissioner will select the winner by lot from among those tied for the 
highest number of votes.
    (d) To select a nonvoting member to represent industry interests, 
the Commissioner will publish, for each committee for which the 
Commissioner has determined to appoint a nonvoting member, a notice 
requesting that, within 30 days, any industry organization interested in 
participating in the selection of an appropriate nonvoting member to 
represent industry interests send a letter stating that interest to the 
FDA employee designated in the notice. After 30 days, a letter will be 
sent to each organization that has expressed an interest, attaching a 
complete list of all such organizations, and stating that it is their 
responsibility to consult with each other in selecting, within 60 days 
after receipt of the letter, a single nonvoting member to represent 
industry interests for that committee. If no individual is selected 
within 60 days, the Commissioner will select the nonvoting member 
representing industry interests.
    (e) The Commissioner has determined that, because nonvoting members 
representing consumer and industry interests are included on advisory 
committees specifically for the purpose of representing such interests 
and have no vote, any financial interest covered by 18 U.S.C. 208(a) in 
the class which the member represents is irrelevant to the services the 
Government expects from them and thus is hereby exempted under 18 U.S.C. 
208(b) as too remote and inconsequential to affect the integrity of 
their services.

Sec.  14.86  Rights and responsibilities of nonvoting members of 
advisory committees.

    (a) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee selected to 
represent and serve as a liaison with interested individuals, 
associations, and organizations has the same rights as any other 
committee member except that--
    (1) A nonvoting member may vote only on procedural matters such as 
additional rules adopted under Sec.  14.39(a), approval of minutes under 
Sec.  14.60(a), decisions on transcripts under Sec.  14.61(b), and 
future meeting dates;
    (2) A nonvoting member who is a representative of industry interest 
may have access to data and information that constitute a trade secret 
or confidential commercial or financial information as defined in Sec.  
20.61 only if the person has been appointed as a special Government 
employee under Sec.  14.80(b).
    (b) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee is subject to, and 
shall abide by, all rules and regulations adopted by FDA and the 
committee.
    (c) It is the responsibility of the nonvoting consumer and industry 
members of an advisory committee to represent the consumer and industry 
interests in all deliberations.
    (1) A nonvoting member does not represent any particular 
organization or group, but rather represents all interested persons 
within the class which the member is selected to represent. Accordingly, 
an interested person within the class represented by that nonvoting 
member may, upon request, have access to all written statements or oral 
briefings concerning the committee prepared by the nonvoting

[[Page 214]]

member for distribution to any person outside the committee. When 
documents are prepared with non-Government funds, persons desiring 
copies may be required to pay a reasonable fee to cover printing and 
similar costs.
    (2) The nonvoting member reviews all official committee minutes to 
assure their completeness and accuracy.
    (3) The nonvoting member acts as a liaison between the committee and 
the interested persons whom that member represents, and transmits 
requests for information from the committee and relevant information and 
views to the committee. The nonvoting member takes the initiative in 
contacting interested persons whom the member represents to seek out 
relevant information and views and to relate the progress of the 
advisory committee.
    (4) A nonvoting industry member represents all members of the 
industry, and not any particular association, company, product, or 
ingredient. If a matter comes before the committee that directly or 
indirectly affects the company employing the nonvoting industry member, 
the member shall so inform the committee but need not be absent during 
the discussion or decline to participate in the discussion. a nonvoting 
industry member may not discuss the company's position as such, but may 
discuss any matter in general terms. All presentations and discussions 
of scientific data and their interpretation on behalf of a company will 
occur in open session, except as provided in Sec.  14.25(c).
    (5) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee may not make any 
presentation to that advisory committee during a hearing conducted by 
that committee.
    (6) Although a nonvoting member serves in a representative capacity, 
the nonvoting member shall exercise restraint in performing such 
functions and may not engage in unseemly advocacy or attempt to exert 
undue influence over the other members of the committee.
    (d) A nonvoting member of an advisory committee may be removed by 
the Commissioner for failure to comply with this section as well as 
Sec.  14.80(f).



Sec.  14.90  Ad hoc advisory committee members.

    In selecting members of an ad hoc advisory committee, the 
Commissioner may use the procedures in Sec. Sec.  14.82 and 14.84 or any 
other procedure deemed appropriate.



Sec.  14.95  Compensation of advisory committee members.

    (a)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) (2) and (3) of this 
section, all voting advisory committee members shall, and nonvoting 
members may, be appointed as special Government employees and receive a 
consultant fee and be reimbursed for travel expenses, including per diem 
in lieu of subsistence, unless such compensation and reimbursement are 
waived.
    (2) Members of the Technical Electronic Product Radiation Safety 
Standards Committee (TEPRSSC) are not appointed as special Government 
employees. Any member of TEPRSSC who is not a Federal employee or member 
of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the 
Public Health Service, shall receive a consultant fee and be reimbursed 
for travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, unless 
such compensation and reimbursement are waived.
    (3) Voting and nonvoting advisory committee members who are members 
of the uniformed services, including the Commissioned Corps of the 
Public Health Service, provide service on Food and Drug Administration 
advisory committees as part of their assigned functions, are not 
appointed as special government employees, but are reimbursed by the 
Food and Drug Administration for travel expenses.
    (b) Notwithstanding the member's primary residence, an advisory 
committee member, while attending meetings of the full committee or a 
subcommittee, will be paid whether the meetings are held in the 
Washington, DC, area or elsewhere.
    (c) A committee member who participates in any agency-directed 
assignment will be paid at an hourly rate when doing assigned work at 
home, a place of business, or in an FDA facility located within the 
member's commuting area, and at a daily rate when

[[Page 215]]

required to travel outside of that commuting area to perform the 
assignment. A committee member will not be paid for time spent on normal 
preparation for a committee meeting.
    (1) An agency-directed assignment is an assignment that meets the 
following criteria:
    (i) An activity that requires undertaking a definitive study. The 
activity must produce a tangible end product, usually a written report. 
Examples are:
    (a) An analysis of the risks and benefits of the use of a class of 
drugs or a report on a specific problem generated by an IND or NDA;
    (b) The performance of similar investigations or analysis of complex 
industry submissions to support advisory committee deliberations other 
than normal meeting preparation;
    (c) The preparation of a statistical analysis leading to an estimate 
of toxicologically safe dose levels; and
    (d) The design or analysis of animal studies of toxicity, 
mutagenicity, teratogenicity, or carcinogenicity.
    (ii) The performance of an IND or NDA review or similar review.
    (2) A committee member who undertakes a special assignment, the end 
product of which does not represent the end product of the advisory 
committee, but rather of the committee member's own assignment, can be 
compensated. Should this preparatory work by members collectively result 
in an end product of the committee, this is to be considered normal 
meeting preparation and committee members are not to be compensated for 
this work.
    (d) Salary while in travel status is authorized when a committee 
member's ordinary pursuits are interrupted for the substantial portion 
of an additional day beyond the day or days spent in performing those 
services, and as a consequence the committee member loses some regular 
compensation. This applies on weekends and holidays if the special 
Government employee loses income that would otherwise be earned on that 
day. For travel purposes, a substantial portion of a day is defined as 
50 percent of the working day, and the traveler will be paid at a daily 
rate.

              Subpart H_Color Additive Advisory Committees



Sec.  14.140  Establishment of a color additive advisory committee.

    The Commissioner will establish a color additive advisory committee 
under the following circumstances:
    (a) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it 
would be in the public interest for a color additive advisory committee 
to review and make recommendations about the safety of a color additive 
on which important issues are pending before FDA and for interested 
persons to present information and views at an oral public hearing 
before a color additive advisory committee.
    (b) There is an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C 
Act concerning the safety of a color additive, including its potential 
or actual carcinogenicity, that requires the exercise of scientific 
judgment and a person who would be adversely affected by the issuance, 
amendment, or repeal of a regulation listing a color additive requests 
that the matter, or the Commissioner as a matter of discretion 
determines that the matter should, be referred to a color additive 
advisory committee.
    (1) Paragraph (b) does not apply to any issue arising under the 
transitional provisions in section 203 of the Color Additive Amendments 
of 1960 relating to provisional listing of commercially established 
colors. A color

[[Page 221]]

additive advisory committee to consider any such matter will be 
established under paragraph (a) of this section.
    (2) A request for establishment of a color additive advisory 
committee is to be made in accordance with Sec.  10.30. The Commissioner 
may deny any petition if inadequate grounds are stated for establishing 
a color additive advisory committee. A request for establishment of a 
color additive advisory committee may not rest on mere allegations or 
denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a 
genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires scientific judgment 
and justifies a hearing before a color additive advisory committee. When 
it conclusively appears from the request for a color additive advisory 
committee that the matter is premature or that it does not involve an 
issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the FD&C Act or that there 
is no genuine and substantial issue of fact requiring scientific 
judgment, or for any other reason a color additive advisory committee is 
not justified, the Commissioner may deny the establishment of a color 
additive advisory committee.
    (3) Establishment of a color additive advisory committee on the 
request of an interested person is conditioned upon receipt of the 
application fee specified in Sec.  14.155.
    (4) Any person adversely affected may request referral of the matter 
to a color additive advisory committee at any time before, or within 30 
days after, publication of an order of the Commissioner acting upon a 
color additive petition or proposal.



Sec.  14.142  Functions of a color additive advisory committee.

    (a) A color additive advisory committee reviews all available 
information relating to the matter referred to it, including all 
information contained in any pertinent color additive petition and in 
FDA files. All information reviewed is placed on public display and is 
available for review at the office of the Division of Dockets 
Management.
    (b) The Commissioner specifies to the color additive advisory 
committee, in writing, the issues on which review and recommendations 
are requested.
    (c) The date of the first meeting of a color additive advisory 
committee, following receipt of the administrative record by each of the 
committee members, is designated as the beginning of the period allowed 
for consideration of the matter by the committee. Within 60 days after 
the first meeting, unless the time is extended as provided in paragraph 
(d) of this section, the Chairperson of the committee shall certify to 
the Commissioner the report containing the recommendations of the 
committee, including any minority report. The report states the 
recommendations of the committee and the reasons or basis for them. The 
report includes copies of all material considered by the committee in 
addition to the administrative record furnished to it.
    (d) If the Chairperson concludes that the color additive advisory 
committee needs additional time, the Chairperson shall so inform the 
Commissioner in writing and may certify the report of the committee to 
the Commissioner within 90 days instead of 60 days.
    (e) More than one matter may be handled concurrently by a color 
additive advisory committee.



Sec.  14.145  Procedures of a color additive advisory committee.

    (a) A color additive advisory committee is subject to all the 
requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this part.
    (b) All interested persons have a right to consult with the color 
additive advisory committee reviewing a matter and to submit information 
and views to a color additive advisory committee, in accordance with the 
procedures in this part.



Sec.  14.147  Membership of a color additive advisory committee.

    (a) The members of a color additive advisory committee are selected 
in the following manner:
    (1) If a color additive advisory committee is established for 
purposes that do not include review of an issue arising under section 
721(b)(5)(B) of the act, or is established on the initiative of the 
Commissioner, the Commissioner may use the procedure in paragraph

[[Page 222]]

(a)(2) of this section to select the members or may use an existing 
standing advisory committee listed in Sec.  14.100, or may establish a 
new advisory committee under this subpart. Once the Commissioner has 
established a color additive advisory committee under this paragraph and 
has referred to it a matter relating to a color additive, no interested 
person may subsequently request that an additional or different color 
additive advisory committee be established to review and make 
recommendations about that color additive.
    (2) If the Commissioner established a color additive advisory 
committee to review an issue arising under section 721(b)(5)(B) of the 
FD&C Act on the request of an interested person, it shall be established 
under the following requirements:
    (i) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this 
section, the Commissioner will request the National Academy of Sciences 
to select the members of a color additive advisory committee from among 
experts qualified in the subject matter to be reviewed by the committee, 
and of adequately diversified professional backgrounds. The Commissioner 
will appoint one of the members as the Chairperson.
    (ii) If the National Academy of Sciences is unable or refuses to 
select the members of a color additive advisory committee, the 
Commissioner will select the members.
    (iii) If the Commissioner and the requesting party agree, section 
721(b)(5)(D) of the FD&C Act may be waived and the matter may be 
referred to any standing advisory committee listed in Sec.  14.100 or to 
any advisory committee established under any other procedure that is 
mutually agreeable. Once the Commissioner has established a color 
additive advisory committee and has referred to it a matter relating to 
a color additive, no interested person may subsequently request that an 
additional or different color additive advisory committee be established 
to review and make recommendations about that color additive.
    (b) Members of a color additive advisory committee are subject to 
the requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act and this subpart, 
except that no member of a color additive advisory committee may by 
reason of such membership alone be a special government employee or be 
subject to the conflict of interest laws and regulations.



Sec.  14.155  Fees and compensation pertaining to a color additive
advisory committee.

    (a) When a matter is referred to a color additive advisory 
committee, all related costs, including personal compensation of 
committee members, travel, materials, and other costs, are borne by the 
person requesting the referral, such costs to be assessed on the basis 
of actual cost to the government. The compensation of such costs 
includes personal compensation of committee members at a rate not to 
exceed $128.80 per member per day.
    (b) In the case of a request for referral to a color additive 
advisory committee, a special advance deposit is to be made in the 
amount of $2,500. Where required, further advances in increments of 
$2,500 each are to be made upon request of the Commissioner. All 
deposits for referrals to a color additive advisory committee in excess 
of actual expenses will be refunded to the depositor.
    (c) All deposits and fees required by this section are to be paid by 
money order, bank draft, or certified check drawn to the order of the 
Food and Drug Administration, collectible at par in Washington, DC. All 
deposits and fees are to be forwarded to the Associate Commissioner for 
Management and Operations, Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers 
Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and after appropriate record of them is made, 
they will be transmitted to the Treasurer of the United States for 
deposit in the special account ``Salaries and Expenses, Certification, 
Inspection, and Other Services, Food and Drug Administration.''
    (d) The Commissioner may waive or refund such fees in whole or in 
part when, in the Commissioner's judgment, such action will promote the 
public interest. Any person who believes that payment of these fees will 
be a hardship may petition the Commissioner

[[Page 223]]

under Sec.  10.30 to waive or refund the fees.



       Subpart I_Advisory Committees for Human Prescription Drugs



Sec.  14.160  Establishment of standing technical advisory committees
for human prescription drugs.

    The standing technical advisory committees for human prescription 
drugs are established to advise the Commissioner:
    (a) Generally on the safety and effectiveness, including the 
labeling and advertising, and regulatory control of the human 
prescription drugs falling within the pharmacologic class covered by the 
advisory committee and on the scientific standards appropriate for a 
determination of safety and effectiveness in that class of drugs.
    (b) Specifically on any particular matter involving a human 
prescription drug pending before FDA, including whether the available 
information is adequate to support a determination that--
    (1) A particular IND study may properly be conducted;
    (2) A particular drug meets the statutory standard for proof of 
safety and effectiveness necessary for approval or continued approval 
for marketing; or
    (3) A particular drug is properly classified as a new drug, an old 
drug, or a banned drug.



Sec.  14.171  Utilization of an advisory committee on the initiative
of FDA.

    (a) Any matter involving a human prescription drug under review 
within the agency may, in the discretion of the Commissioner, be the 
subject of a public hearing and continuing or periodic review by the 
appropriate standing technical advisory committee for human prescription 
drugs. The Commissioner's determinations on the agenda of the committee 
are based upon the priorities of the various matters pending before the 
agency which fall within the pharmacologic class covered by that 
committee.
    (b) High priority for such hearing and review by the appropriate 
standing technical advisory committee for human prescription drugs are 
given to the following types of human prescription drugs:
    (1) Investigational drugs which are potential therapeutic advances 
over currently marketed products from the standpoint of safety or 
effectiveness, or which pose significant safety hazards, or which 
present narrow benefit-risk considerations requiring a close judgmental 
decision on approval for marketing, or which have a novel delivery 
system or formulation, or which are the subject of major scientific or 
public controversy, or which may be subject to special regulatory 
requirements such as a limitation on clinical trials, a patient followup 
requirement, postmarketing Phase IV studies, distributional controls, or 
boxed warnings.
    (2) Marketed drugs for which an important new use has been 
discovered or which pose newly discovered safety hazards, or which are 
the subject of major scientific or public controversy, or which may be 
subject to important regulatory actions such as withdrawal of approval 
for marketing, boxed warnings, distributional controls, or newly 
required scientific studies.
    (c) The committee may request the Commissioner for an opportunity to 
hold a public hearing and to review any matter involving a human 
prescription drug which falls within the pharmacologic class covered by 
the committee. The Commissioner may, after consulting with the committee 
on such request, grant or deny the request in light of the priorities of 
the other matters pending before the committee. Whenever feasible, 
consistent with the other work of the committee, the request will be 
granted.
    (d) For a drug that meets any of the criteria established in 
paragraph (b) of this section, one or more members of or consultants to 
the appropriate advisory committee may be selected for more detailed 
monitoring of the matter and consultation with FDA on behalf of the 
committee. The member or consultant may be invited to attend appropriate 
meetings and shall assist the center in any briefing of the committee on 
that matter.
    (e) An advisory committee may obtain advice and recommendations from 
other agency advisory committees,

[[Page 224]]

consultants, and experts which the advisory committee and the center 
conclude would facilitate the work of the advisory committee.
    (f) Presentation of all relevant information about the matter will 
be made in open session unless it relates to an IND the existence of 
which has not previously been disclosed to the public as defined in 
Sec.  20.81 or is otherwise prohibited from public disclosure under part 
20 and the regulations referenced therein. Sections 314.430 and 601.51 
determine whether, and the extent to which, relevant information may be 
made available for public disclosure, summarized and discussed in open 
session but not otherwise made available for public disclosure, or not 
in any way discussed or disclosed in open session or otherwise disclosed 
to the public.

Sec.  14.172  Utilization of an advisory committee at the request of
an interested person.

    Any interested person may request, under Sec.  10.30, that a 
specific matter relating to a particular human prescription drug be 
submitted to an appropriate advisory committee for a hearing and review 
and recommendations. The request must demonstrate the importance of the 
matter and the reasons why it should be submitted for a hearing at that 
time. The Commissioner may grant or deny the request.



Sec.  14.174  Advice and recommendations in writing.

    Advice and recommendations given by a committee on a specific drug 
or a class of drugs are ordinarily in the form of a written report. The 
report may consist of the approved minutes of the meeting or a separate 
written report. The report responds to the specific issues or questions 
which the Commissioner has addressed to the advisory committee, and 
states the basis of the advice and recommendations of the committee.

Sec.  15.1  Scope.

    The procedures in this part apply when:
    (a) The Commissioner concludes, as a matter of discretion, that it 
is in the public interest to permit persons to present information and 
views at a public hearing on any matter pending before the Food and Drug 
Administation.
    (b) The act or regulation specifically provides for a public hearing 
before the Commissioner on a matter, e.g., Sec.  330.10(a)(8) relating 
to over-the-counter drugs and sections 520 (b) and (f)(1)(B), and 521 of 
the act relating to proposals to allow persons to order custom devices,

requirements under Sec.  808.25(e).
    (c) A person who has right to an opportunity for a formal 
evidentiary public hearing under part 12 waives that opportunity and 
instead requests under Sec.  12.32 a public hearing before the 
Commissioner, and the Commissioner, as a

[[Page 225]]

matter of discretion, accepts the request.



     Subpart B_Procedures for Public Hearing Before the Commissioner



Sec.  15.20  Notice of a public hearing before the Commissioner.

held on a matter, the Commissioner will publish a notice of hearing in 
the Federal Register setting forth the following information:
    (1) If the hearing is under Sec.  15.1 (a) or (b), the notice will 
state the following:
    (i) The purpose of the hearing and the subject matter to be 
considered. If a written document is to be the subject matter of the 
hearing, it will be published as part of the notice, or reference made 
to it if it has already been published in the Federal Register, or the 
notice will state that the document is available from an agency office 
identified in the notice.
    (ii) The time, date, and place of the hearing, or a statement that 
the information will be contained in a subsequent notice.

administrative record, information not already in the record may not be 
considered at the hearing.
    (c) The notice of hearing may require participants to submit the 
text of their presentations in advance of the hearing if the 
Commissioner determines that advance submissions are necessary for the 
panel to formulate useful questions to be posed at the hearing under 
Sec.  15.30(e). The notice may provide for the submission of a 
comprehensive outline as an alternative to the submission of the text if 
the Commissioner determines that submission of an outline will be 
sufficient.

Management within a specified period of time containing the information 
specified in the notice, e.g., name of participant, address, phone 
number, affiliation, if any, topic of presentation and approximate 
amount of time requested for the presentation. If the public interest 
requires, e.g., a hearing is to be conducted within a short period of 
time or is to be primarily attended by individuals without an 
organizational affiliation, the notice may name a specific FDA employee 
and telephone number to whom an oral notice of participation may be 
given or provide for submitting notices of participation at the time of 
the hearing. A written or oral notice of participation must be received 
by the designated person by the close of business of the day specified

consolidate or coordinate their presentations and to request time for a 
joint presentation. The Commissioner may require joint presentations by 
persons with common interests.

persons making oral presentations and the time alloted to each person, 
which will be filed with the Division of Dockets Management and mailed

    (e) The hearing schedule will state whether participants must be 
present by a specified time to be sure to be heard in case the absence 
of participants advances the schedule.

Commissioner, who may serve as a panel in conducting the hearing.
    (b) The hearing will be transcribed.
    (c) Persons may use their alloted time in whatever way they wish, 
consistent with a reasonable and orderly hearing. A person may be

discretion of the presiding officer, to the extent that time permits.
    (e) The presiding officer and any other persons serving on a panel 
may question any person during or at the conclusion of the presentation. 
No other person attending the hearing may question a person making a 
presentation. The presiding officer may, as a matter of discretion, 
permit questions to be submitted to the presiding officer or panel for 
response by them or by persons attending the hearing.

Sec.  16.5  Inapplicability and limited applicability.

    (a) This part does not apply to the following:
    (1) Informal presentation of views before reporting a criminal 
violation under section 305 of the act and section 5 of the Federal 
Import Milk Act and Sec.  1210.31.
    (2) A hearing on a refusal of admission of a food, drug, device, or 
cosmetic under section 801(a) of the act and Sec.  1.94, or of an 
electronic product under section 360(a) of the Public Health Service Act 
and Sec.  1005.20.
    (3) Factory inspections, recalls (except mandatory recalls of 
medical devices intended for human use), regulatory letters, and similar 
compliance activities related to law enforcement.
    (4) A hearing on an order for relabeling, diversion, or destruction 
of shell eggs under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 
U.S.C. 264) and Sec. Sec.  101.17(h) and 115.50 of this chapter.
    (5) A hearing on an order for diversion or destruction of shell eggs 
under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 264), and 
Sec.  118.12 of this chapter.
    (b) If a regulation provides a person with an opportunity for 
hearing and specifies some procedures for the hearing but not a 
comprehensive set of procedures, the procedures in this part apply to 
the extent that they are supplementary and not in conflict with the 
other procedures specified for the hearing. Thus, the procedures in 
subpart A of part 108 relating to emergency permit control are 
supplemented by the nonconflicting procedures in this part, e.g., the 
right to counsel, public notice of the hearing, reconsideration and 
stay, and judicial review.

                   Subpart B_Initiation of Proceedings



Sec.  16.22  Initiation of regulatory hearing.

    (a) A regulatory hearing is initiated by a notice of opportunity for 
hearing from FDA. The notice will--
    (1) Be sent by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any 
other mode of written communication;
    (2) Specify the facts and the action that are the subject of the 
opportunity for a hearing;
    (3) State that the notice of opportunity for hearing and the hearing 
are governed by this part; and
    (4) State the time within which a hearing may be requested, and 
state the name, address, and telephone number of the FDA employee to 
whom any request for hearing is to be addressed.
    (5) Refer to FDA's guideline on electronic media coverage of its 
administrative proceedings (21 CFR part 10, subpart C).
    (b) A person offered an opportunity for a hearing has the amount of 
time specified in the notice, which may not be less than 3 working days 
after receipt of the notice, within which to request a hearing. The 
request may be filed by mail, telegram, telex, personal delivery, or any 
other mode of written communication, addressed to the designated FDA 
employee. If no response is filed within that time, the offer is deemed 
to have been refused and no hearing will be held.
    (c) If a hearing is requested, the Commissioner will designate a 
presiding officer, and the hearing will take place at a time and 
location agreed upon by the party requesting the hearing, the FDA, and 
the presiding officer or, if agreement cannot be reached, at a 
reasonable time and location designated by the presiding officer.
    (d) A notice of opportunity for hearing under this section will not 
operate to delay or stay any administrative action, including 
enforcement action by the agency unless the Commissioner, as a matter of 
discretion, determines that delay or a stay is in the public interest.

[44 FR 22367, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 49 FR 32173, Aug. 13, 1984]

[[Page 230]]



Sec.  16.24  Regulatory hearing required by the act or a regulation.

    (a) A regulatory hearing required by the act or a regulation under 
Sec.  16.1(b) will be initiated in the same manner as other regulatory 
hearings subject to the additional procedures in this section.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) The notice will state whether any action concerning the matter 
that is the subject of the opportunity for hearing is or is not being 
taken pending the hearing under paragraph (d) of this section.
    (d) The Commissioner may take such action pending a hearing under 
this section as the Commissioner concludes is necessary to protect the 
public health, except where expressly prohibited by statute or 
regulation. A hearing to consider action already taken, and not stayed 
by the Commissioner, will be conducted on an expedited basis.
    (e) The hearing may not be required to be held at a time less than 2 
working days after receipt of the request for hearing.
    (f) Before the hearing, FDA will give to the party requesting the 
hearing reasonable notice of the matters to be considered at the 
hearing, including a comprehensive statement of the basis for the 
decision or action taken or proposed that is the subject of the hearing 
and a general summary of the information that will be presented by FDA 
at the hearing in support of the decision or action. This information 
may be given orally or in writing, in the discretion of FDA.
    (g) FDA and the party requesting the hearing will, if feasible, at 
least 1 day before the hearing provide to each other written notice of 
any published articles or written information to be presented at or 
relied on at the hearing. A copy will also be provided in advance if the 
other participant could not reasonably be expected to have or be able to 
obtain a copy. If written notice or a copy is not provided, the 
presiding officer may, if time permits, allow the party who did not 
receive the notice or copy additional time after the close of the 
hearing to make a submission concerning the article or information.

[44 FR 22367, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 26375, June 18, 1982; 
54 FR 9037, Mar. 3, 1989]



Sec.  16.26  Denial of hearing and summary decision.

    (a) A request for a hearing may be denied, in whole or in part, if 
the Commissioner or the FDA official to whom authority is delegated to 
make the final decision on the matter determines that no genuine and 
substantial issue of fact has been raised by the material submitted. If 
the Commissioner or his or her delegate determines that a hearing is not 
justified, written notice of the determination will be given to the 
parties explaining the reason for denial.
    (b) After a hearing commences, the presiding officer may issue a 
summary decision on any issue in the hearing if the presiding officer 
determines from the material submitted in connection with the hearing, 
or from matters officially noticed, that there is no genuine and 
substantial issue of fact respecting that issue. For the purpose of this 
paragraph, a hearing commences upon the receipt by FDA of a request for 
hearing submitted under Sec.  16.22(b).
    (c) The Commissioner or his or her delegate may review any summary 
decision of the presiding officer issued under paragraph (b) of this 
section at the request of a party or on the Commissioner's or his or her 
delegate's own initiative.

[53 FR 4615, Feb. 17, 1988, as amended at 69 FR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004]



              Subpart C_Commissioner and Presiding Officer



Sec.  16.40  Commissioner.

    Whenever the Commissioner has delegated authority on a matter for 
which a regulatory hearing is available under this part, the functions 
of the Commissioner under this part may be performed by any of the 
officials to whom the authority has been delegated, e.g., a center 
director.

[69 FR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004]

[[Page 231]]



Sec.  16.42  Presiding officer.

    (a) An FDA employee to whom the Commissioner delegates such 
authority, or any other agency employee designated by an employee to 
whom such authority is delegated, or, consistent with 5 CFR 930.209(b) 
or (c), an administrative law judge to whom such authority is delegated, 
may serve as the presiding officer and conduct a regulatory hearing 
under this part.
    (b) In a regulatory hearing required by the act or a regulation, the 
presiding officer is to be free from bias or prejudice and may not have 
participated in the investigation or action that is the subject of the 
hearing or be subordinate to a person, other than the Commissioner, who 
has participated in such investigation or action.
    (c)(1) The Commissioner or the delegate under Sec.  16.40 is not 
precluded by this section from prior participation in the investigation 
or action that is the subject of the hearing. If there has been prior 
participation, the Commissioner or the delegate should, if feasible, 
designate a presiding officer for the hearing who is not a subordinate. 
Thus, if the Commissioner's authority to make a final decision has been 
delegated to a center director, the presiding officer may be an official 
in another center or the office of the Commissioner. The exercise of 
general supervisory responsibility, or the designation of the presiding 
officer, does not constitute prior participation in the investigation or 
action that is the subject of the hearing so as to preclude the 
Commissioner or delegate from designating a subordinate as the presiding 
officer.
    (2) The party requesting a hearing may make a written request to 
have the Commissioner or the delegate under Sec.  16.40 be the presiding 
officer, notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section. If accepted, 
as a matter of discretion, by the Commissioner or the delegate, the 
request is binding upon the party making the request.
    (3) A different presiding officer may be substituted for the one 
originally designated under Sec.  16.22 without notice to the parties.

[44 FR 22367, Apr. 13, 1979, as amended at 54 FR 9037, Mar. 3, 1989; 67 
FR 53306, Aug. 15, 2002]



Sec.  16.44  Communication to presiding officer and Commissioner.

    (a) Regulatory hearings are not subject to the separation of 
functions rules in Sec.  10.55.
    (b) Those persons who are directly involved in the investigation or 
presentation of the position of FDA or any party at a regulatory hearing 
that is required by the act or a regulation should avoid any off-the-
record communication on the matter to the presiding officer or the 
Commissioner or their advisors if the communication is inconsistent with 
the requirement of Sec.  16.95(b)(1) that the administrative record be 
the exclusive record for decision. If any communication of this type 
occurs, it is to be reduced to writing and made part of the record, and 
the other party provided an opportunity to respond.
    (c) A copy of any letter or memorandum of meeting between a 
participant in the hearing and the presiding officer or the 
Commissioner, e.g., a response by the presiding officer to a request for 
a change in the time of the hearing, is to be sent to all participants 
by the person writing the letter or the memorandum.



               Subpart D_Procedures for Regulatory Hearing



Sec.  16.60  Hearing procedure.

    (a) A regulatory hearing is public, except when the Commissioner 
determines that all or part of a hearing should be closed to prevent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy; to prevent the 
disclosure of a trade secret or confidential commercial or financial 
information that is not available for public disclosure under Sec.  
20.61; or to protect investigatory records complied for law enforcement 
purposes that are not available for public disclosure under Sec.  20.64.
    (1) The Commissioner may determine that a regulatory hearing is 
closed either on the Commissioner's initiative or on a request by the 
party asking for a regulatory hearing, in the request for the hearing.

[[Page 232]]

    (2) If the hearing is a private hearing, no persons other than the 
party requesting the hearing, counsel and witnesses, and an employee or 
consultant or other person subject to a commercial arrangement as 
defined in Sec.  20.81(a) and FDA representatives with a direct 
professional interest in the subject matter of the proceeding are 
entitled to attend.
    (b) A regulatory hearing will be conducted by a presiding officer. 
Employees of FDA will first give a full and complete statement of the 
action which is the subject of the hearing, together with the 
information and reasons supporting it, and may present any oral or 
written information relevant to the hearing. The party requesting the 
hearing may then present any oral or written information relevant to the 
hearing. All parties may confront and conduct reasonable cross-
examination of any person (except for the presiding officer and counsel 
for the parties) who makes any statement on the matter at the hearing.
    (c) The hearing is informal in nature, and the rules of evidence do 
not apply. No motions or objections relating to the admissibility of 
information and views will be made or considered, but any other party 
may comment upon or rebut all such data, information, and views.
    (d) The presiding officer may order the hearing to be transcribed. 
The party requesting the hearing may have the hearing transcribed, at 
the party's expense, in which case a copy of the transcript is to be 
furnished to FDA. Any transcript of the hearing will be included with 
the presiding officer's report of the hearing.
    (e) The presiding officer shall prepare a written report of the 
hearing. All written material presented at the hearing will be attached 
to the report. Whenever time permits, the parties to the hearing will be 
given the opportunity to review and comment on the presiding officer's 
report of the hearing.
    (f) The presiding officer shall include as part of the report of the 
hearing a finding on the credibility of witnesses (other than expert 
witnesses) whenever credibility is a material issue, and shall include a 
recommended decision, with a statement of reasons, unless the 
Commissioner directs otherwise.
    (g) The presiding officer has the power to take such actions and 
make such rulings as are necessary or appropriate to maintain order and 
to conduct a fair, expeditious, and impartial hearing, and to enforce 
the requirements of this part concerning the conduct of hearings. The 
presiding officer may direct that the hearing be conducted in any 
suitable manner permitted by law and these regulations.
    (h) The Commissioner or the presiding officer has the power under 
Sec.  10.19 to suspend, modify, or waive any provision of this part.

officer at the hearing or after if specifically permitted by the 
presiding officer.
    (3) Any transcript of the hearing.
    (4) The presiding officer's report of the hearing and comments on

in Sec.  16.44(c).
    (b) The record of the regulatory hearing is closed to the submission 
of information and views, at the close of the hearing, unless the 
presiding officer specifically permits additional time for a further 
submission.

    Part 20 governs the availability for public disclosure of each 
document that is a part of the administrative record of a regulatory

Sec.  16.95  Administrative decision and record for decision.

initiative under Sec.  16.1(a), the Commissioner shall consider the 
administrative record of the hearing specified in Sec.  16.80(a) 
together with all other relevant information and views available to FDA 
in determining whether regulatory action should be taken and, if so, in 
what form.
    (b) With respect to a regulatory hearing required by the act or a 
regulation under Sec.  16.1(b)--
    (1) The administrative record of the hearing specified in Sec.  
16.80(a) constitutes the exclusive record for decision;

presiding officer or the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (c) The parties may be represented by counsel, who may be present at

    (a) At any time after the filing of a complaint, a party may move, 
with or without supporting affidavits (which, for purposes of this part, 
shall include

[[Page 239]]

declarations under penalty of perjury), for a summary decision on any 
issue in the hearing. The other party may, within 30 days after service 
of the motion, which may be extended for an additional 10 days for good 
cause, serve opposing affidavits or countermove for summary decision.
    The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call for 
the submission of briefs.
    (b) The presiding officer shall grant the motion if the pleadings, 
affidavits, and other material filed in the record, or matters 
officially noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any 
material fact and that the party is entitled to summary decision as a 
matter of law.
    (c) Affidavits shall set forth only such facts as would be 
admissible in evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is 
competent to testify to the matters stated. When a motion for summary 
decision is made and supported as provided in this regulation, a party 
opposing the motion may not rest on mere allegations or denials or 
general descriptions of positions and contentions; affidavits or other 
responses must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine 
issue of material fact for the hearing.
    (d) If, on motion under this section, a summary decision is not 
rendered on all issues or for all the relief asked, and if additional 
facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will issue an order 
specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy and 
directing further evidentiary proceedings on facts still at issue. The 
facts specified not to be at issue shall be deemed established.
    (e) Except as provided in Sec.  17.18, a party may not obtain 
interlocutory review by the entity deciding the appeal (currently the 
DAB) of a partial summary decision of the presiding officer. A review of 
final summary decisions on all issues may be had through the procedure 
set forth in Sec.  17.47.



Sec.  17.18  Interlocutory appeal from ruling of presiding officer.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, rulings of 
the presiding officer may not be appealed before consideration on appeal 
of the entire record of the hearing.
    (b) A ruling of the presiding officer is subject to interlocutory 
appeal to the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) if the 
presiding officer certifies on the record or in writing that immediate 
review is necessary to prevent exceptional delay, expense, or prejudice 
to any participant, or substantial harm to the public interest.
    (c) When an interlocutory appeal is made, a participant may file a 
brief on the appeal only if specifically authorized by the presiding 
officer or the entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB), and if 
such authorization is granted, only within the period allowed by the 
presiding officer or the entity deciding the appeal. If a participant is 
authorized to file a brief, any other participant may file a brief in 
opposition, within the period allowed by the entity deciding the appeal 
(currently the DAB). The deadline for filing an interlocutory appeal is 
subject to the discretion of the presiding officer.

    (d)(1) Within 10 days of service of a request for production of 
documents, a party may file a motion for a protective order.
    (2) The presiding officer may grant a motion for a protective order, 
in whole or in part, if he or she finds that the discovery sought:
    (i) Is unduly costly or burdensome,
    (ii) Will unduly delay the proceeding, or
    (iii) Seeks privileged information.
    (3) The burden of showing that a protective order is necessary shall 
be on the party seeking the order.
    (4) The burden of showing that documents should be produced is on 
the party seeking their production.
    (e) The presiding officer shall order depositions upon oral 
questions only upon a showing that:
    (1) The information sought cannot be obtained by alternative 
methods, and
    (2) There is a substantial reason to believe that relevant and 
probative evidence may otherwise not be preserved for presentation by a 
witness at the hearing.



Sec.  17.25  Exchange of witness lists, witness statements, and exhibits.

    (a) At least 30 days before the hearing, or by such other time as is 
specified by the presiding officer, the parties shall exchange witness 
lists, copies of prior written statements of proposed witnesses, and 
copies of proposed hearing exhibits, including written testimony.
    (b)(1) If a party objects to the proposed admission of evidence not 
exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, the 
presiding officer will exclude such evidence if he or she determines 
that the failure to comply with paragraph (a) of this section should 
result in its exclusion.
    (2) Unless the presiding officer finds that extraordinary 
circumstances justified the failure to make a timely exchange of witness 
lists under paragraph (a) of this section, he or she must exclude from 
the party's hearing evidence the testimony of any witness whose name 
does not appear on the witness list.
    (3) If the presiding officer finds that extraordinary circumstances 
existed, the presiding officer must then determine whether the admission 
of the testimony of any witness whose name does not appear on the 
witness lists exchanged under paragraph (a) of this section would cause 
substantial prejudice to the objecting party. If the presiding officer 
finds that there is not substantial prejudice, the evidence may be 
admitted. If the presiding officer finds that there is substantial 
prejudice, the presiding officer may exclude the evidence, or at his or 
her discretion, may postpone the hearing for such time as is necessary 
for the objecting party to prepare and respond to the evidence.
    (c) Unless a party objects within 5 days prior to the hearing, 
documents exchanged in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section 
will be deemed to be authentic for the purpose of admissibility at the 
hearing.



Sec.  17.27  Hearing subpoenas.

    (a) A party wishing to procure the appearance and testimony of any 
individual at the hearing may, when authorized by law, request that the 
presiding officer issue a subpoena.
    (b) A subpoena requiring the attendance and testimony of an 
individual may also require the individual to produce documents at the 
hearing.
    (c) A party seeking a subpoena shall file a written request therefor 
not less than 20 days before the date fixed for the hearing unless 
otherwise allowed by the presiding officer, upon a showing by the party 
of good cause. Such request shall specify any documents to be produced 
and shall designate the witnesses and describe the address and location 
thereof with sufficient particularity to permit such witnesses to be 
found.
    (d) The subpoena shall specify the time and place at which the 
witness is to appear and any documents the witness is to produce.
    (e) The party seeking the subpoena shall serve it in the manner 
prescribed for service of a complaint in Sec.  17.7.

[[Page 242]]

    (f) If a party or the individual to whom the subpoena is directed 
believes a subpoena to be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, 
or unduly burdensome, or if it wishes to raise any other objection or 
privilege recognized by law, the party or individual may file a motion 
to quash the subpoena within 10 days after service or on or before the 
time specified in the subpoena for compliance if it is less than 10 days 
after service. Such a filing will state the basis for the motion to 
quash. The presiding officer may quash or modify the subpoena or order 
it implemented, as justice may require.



Sec.  17.28  Protective order.

    (a) A party or a prospective witness may file a motion for a 
protective order with respect to discovery sought by a party or with 
respect to the hearing, seeking to limit the availability or disclosure 
of evidence.
    (b) When issuing a protective order, the presiding officer may make 
any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from 
oppression or undue burden or expense, or to protect trade secrets or 
confidential commercial information, as defined in Sec.  20.61 of this 
chapter, information the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly 
unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or other information that 
would be withheld from public disclosure under 21 CFR part 20. Such 
orders may include, but are not limited to, one or more of the 
following:
    (1) That the discovery not be had;
    (2) That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and 
conditions, including a designation of the time or place;
    (3) That the discovery may be had only through a method of discovery 
provided for by this part other than that requested;
    (4) That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of 
discovery be limited to certain matters;
    (5) That the contents of discovery or evidence be sealed;
    (6) That the information not be disclosed to the public or be 
disclosed only in a designated way; or
    (7) That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or 
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the 
presiding officer.



Sec.  17.29  Fees.

    The party requesting a subpoena shall pay the cost of the fees and 
mileage of any witness subpoenaed in the amounts that would be payable 
to a witness in a proceeding in a United States District Court. A check 
for witness fees and mileage shall accompany the subpoena when served.



Sec.  17.30  Computation of time.

    (a) In computing any period of time under this part or in an order 
issued thereunder, the time begins with the day following the act or 
event, and includes the last day of the period, unless either such day 
is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, in which event the time 
includes the next business day.
    (b) When the period of time allowed is less than 7 days, 
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays shall be excluded 
from the computation.
    (c) When a document has been served or issued by placing it in the 
mail, an additional 5 days will be added to the time permitted for any 
response.



Sec.  17.31  Form, filing, and service of papers.

    (a) Form. (1) Documents filed with the Division of Dockets 
Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, 
rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, shall include an original and two copies.
    (2) The first page of every pleading and paper filed in the 
proceeding shall contain a caption setting forth the title of the 
action, the case number assigned by the Office of the Chief Counsel, and 
designation of the pleading or paper (e.g., ``motion to quash 
subpoena'').
    (3) Every pleading shall be signed by, and shall contain the address 
and telephone number of, the party or the person on whose behalf the 
pleading was filed, or his or her counsel.
    (4) Pleadings or papers are considered filed when they are received 
by the Division of Dockets Management.
    (b) Service. A party filing a document with the Division of Dockets 
Management under this part shall, no later

[[Page 243]]

than the time of filing, serve a copy of such document on every other 
party. Service upon any party of any document, other than service of a 
complaint, shall be made by delivering a copy personally or by placing a 
copy of the document in the United States mail or express delivery 
service, postage prepaid and addressed, to the party's last known 
address. When a party is represented by counsel, service shall be made 
on such counsel in lieu of the actual party.
    (c) Proof of service. A certificate of the individual serving the 
document by personal delivery or by mail, setting forth the time and 
manner of service, shall be proof of service.



Sec.  17.32  Motions.

    (a) Any application to the presiding officer for an order or ruling 
shall be by motion. Motions shall state the relief sought, the authority 
relied upon, and the facts alleged, and shall be filed with the Division 
of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 
Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, delivered to the presiding 
officer, and served on all other parties.
    (b) Except for motions made during a prehearing conference or at the 
hearing, all motions shall be in writing. The presiding officer may 
require that oral motions be reduced to writing.
    (c) Within 15 days after a written motion is served, or such other 
time as may be fixed by the presiding officer, any party may file a 
response to such motion.
    (d) The presiding officer may not grant a written motion before the 
time for filing responses thereto has expired, except upon consent of 
the parties or following a hearing on the motion, but may overrule or 
deny such motion without awaiting a response.



Sec.  17.33  The hearing and burden of proof.

    (a) The presiding officer shall conduct a hearing on the record to 
determine whether the respondent is liable for a civil money penalty 
and, if so, the appropriate amount of any such civil money penalty 
considering any aggravating or mitigating factors.
    (b) In order to prevail, the Center must prove respondent's 
liability and the appropriateness of the penalty under the applicable 
statute by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (c) The respondent must prove any affirmative defenses and any 
mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence.
    (d) The hearing shall be open to the public unless otherwise ordered 
by the presiding officer, who may order closure only to protect trade 
secrets or confidential commercial information, as defined in Sec.  
20.61 of this chapter, information the disclosure of which would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, or other 
information that would be withheld from public disclosure under part 20 
of this chapter.



Sec.  17.34  Determining the amount of penalties and assessments.

    (a) When determining an appropriate amount of civil money penalties 
and assessments, the presiding officer and the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs or entity designated by the Commissioner to decide the appeal 
(currently the DAB) shall evaluate any circumstances that mitigate or 
aggravate the violation and shall articulate in their opinions the 
reasons that support the penalties and assessments imposed.
    (b) The presiding officer and the entity deciding the appeal shall 
refer to the factors identified in the statute under which the penalty 
is assessed for purposes of determining the amount of penalty.
    (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the 
presiding officer or the entity deciding the appeal from considering any 
other factors that in any given case may mitigate or aggravate the 
offense for which penalties and assessments are imposed.



Sec.  17.35  Sanctions.

    (a) The presiding officer may sanction a person, including any party 
or counsel for:
    (1) Failing to comply with an order, subpoena, rule, or procedure 
governing the proceeding;
    (2) Failing to prosecute or defend an action; or

[[Page 244]]

    (3) Engaging in other misconduct that interferes with the speedy, 
orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing.
    (b) Any such sanction, including, but not limited to, those listed 
in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section, shall reasonably relate 
to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct.
    (c) When a party fails to comply with a discovery order, including 
discovery and subpoena provisions of this part, the presiding officer 
may:
    (1) Draw an inference in favor of the requesting party with regard 
to the information sought;
    (2) Prohibit the party failing to comply with such order from 
introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise relying upon, testimony 
relating to the information sought; and
    (3) Strike any part of the pleadings or other submissions of the 
party failing to comply with such request.
    (d) The presiding officer may exclude from participation in the 
hearing any legal counsel, party, or witness who refuses to obey an 
order of the presiding officer. In the case of repeated refusal, the 
presiding officer may grant judgment to the opposing party.
    (e) If a party fails to prosecute or defend an action under this 
part after service of a notice of hearing, the presiding officer may 
dismiss the action or may issue an initial decision imposing penalties 
and assessments.
    (f) The presiding officer may refuse to consider any motion, 
request, response, brief, or other document that is not filed in a 
timely fashion or in compliance with the rules of this part.
    (g) Sanctions imposed under this section may be the subject of an 
interlocutory appeal as allowed in Sec.  17.18(b), provided that no such 
appeal will stay or delay a proceeding.



Sec.  17.37  Witnesses.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, testimony 
at the hearing shall be given orally by witnesses under oath or 
affirmation.
    (b) Direct testimony shall be admitted in the form of a written 
declaration submitted under penalty of perjury. Any such written 
declaration must be provided to all other parties along with the last 
known address of the witness. Any prior written statements of witnesses 
proposed to testify at the hearing shall be exchanged as provided in 
Sec.  17.25(a).
    (c) The presiding officer shall exercise reasonable control over the 
manner and order of questioning witnesses and presenting evidence so as 
to:
    (1) Make the examination and presentation effective for the 
ascertainment of the truth;
    (2) Avoid undue consumption of time; and
    (3) Protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.
    (d) The presiding officer shall permit the parties to conduct such 
cross-examination as may be required for a full disclosure of the facts.
    (e) At the discretion of the presiding officer, a witness may be 
cross-examined on relevant matters without regard to the scope of his or 
her direct examination. To the extent permitted by the presiding 
officer, a witness may be cross-examined on relevant matters with regard 
to the scope of his or her direct examination. To the extent permitted 
by the presiding officer, cross-examination on matters outside the scope 
of direct examination shall be conducted in the manner of direct 
examination and may proceed by leading questions only if the witness is 
a hostile witness, an adverse party, or a witness identified with an 
adverse party.
    (f) Upon motion of any party, the presiding officer may order 
witnesses excluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of the other 
witnesses. This rule does not authorize exclusion of:
    (1) A party who is an individual;
    (2) In the case of a party that is not an individual, an officer or 
employee of the party designated to be the party's sole representative 
for purposes of the hearing; or
    (3) An individual whose presence is shown by a party to be essential 
to the presentation of its case, including an individual employed by a 
party engaged in assisting counsel for the party.
    (g) If a witness' testimony is submitted in writing prior to cross-
examination, the cross-examining party need not subpoena the witness or 
pay for his or her travel to the hearing. The

[[Page 245]]

sponsoring party is responsible for producing the witness at its own 
expense, and failure to do so shall result in the striking of the 
witness' testimony.



Sec.  17.39  Evidence.

    (a) The presiding officer shall determine the admissibility of 
evidence.
    (b) Except as provided in this part, the presiding officer shall not 
be bound by the ``Federal Rules of Evidence.'' However, the presiding 
officer may apply the ``Federal Rules of Evidence'' when appropriate, 
e.g., to exclude unreliable evidence.
    (c) The presiding officer shall exclude evidence that is not 
relevant or material.
    (d) Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is 
substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of 
the issues, or by considerations of undue delay or needless presentation 
of cumulative evidence.
    (e) Relevant evidence may be excluded if it is privileged under 
Federal law.
    (f) Evidence of furnishing or offering or promising to furnish, or 
accepting or offering or promising to accept, a valuable consideration 
in settling or attempting to settle a civil money penalty assessment 
which was disputed as to either validity or amount, is not admissible to 
prove liability for or invalidity of the civil money penalty or its 
amount. Evidence of conduct or statements made in settlement 
negotiations is likewise not admissible. This rule does not require the 
exclusion of any evidence otherwise discoverable merely because it is 
presented in the course of settlement negotiations. This rule also does 
not require exclusion when the evidence is offered for another purpose, 
such as proving bias or prejudice of a witness or opposing a contention 
of undue delay.
    (g) The presiding officer may in his or her discretion permit the 
parties to introduce rebuttal witnesses and evidence.
    (h) All documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record 
shall be open to examination by all parties, unless otherwise ordered by 
the presiding officer pursuant to Sec.  17.28.



Sec.  17.41  The administrative record.

    (a) The hearing will be recorded and transcribed. Witnesses, 
participants, and counsel have 30 days from the time the transcript 
becomes available to propose corrections in the transcript of oral 
testimony. Corrections are permitted only for transcription errors. The 
presiding officer shall promptly order justified corrections. 
Transcripts may be obtained following the hearing from the Division of 
Dockets Management at a cost not to exceed the actual cost of 
duplication.
    (b) The transcript of testimony, exhibits, and other evidence 
admitted at the hearing and all papers and requests filed in the 
proceeding constitute the administrative record for the decision by the 
presiding officer and the entity designated by the Commissioner of Food 
and Drugs to decide the appeal, currently the DAB.
    (c) The administrative record may be inspected and copied (upon 
payment of a reasonable fee) by anyone unless otherwise ordered by the 
presiding officer, who shall upon motion of any party order otherwise 
when necessary to protect trade secrets or confidential commercial 
information, as defined in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter, information the 
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy, or other information that would be withheld from 
public disclosure under part 20.



Sec.  17.43  Posthearing briefs.

    Any party may file a posthearing brief. The presiding officer shall 
fix the time for filing such briefs (which shall be filed 
simultaneously), which shall not exceed 60 days from the date the 
parties received the transcript of the hearing or, if applicable, the 
stipulated record. Such briefs may be accompanied by proposed findings 
of fact and conclusions of law. The presiding officer may permit the 
parties to file responsive briefs. No brief may exceed 30 pages 
(exclusive of proposed findings and conclusions) unless the presiding 
officer has previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so 
complex, or the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify 
longer briefs, in which case the presiding officer may

[[Page 246]]

set a longer page limit. Proposed findings of fact and conclusions of 
law shall not exceed 30 pages unless the presiding officer has 
previously found that the issues in the proceeding are so complex, or 
the administrative record is so voluminous, as to justify longer 
proposed findings and conclusions, in which case the presiding officer 
may set a longer page limit.



Sec.  17.45  Initial decision.

    (a) The presiding officer shall issue an initial decision based only 
on the administrative record. The decision shall contain findings of 
fact, conclusions of law, and the amount of any penalties and 
assessments imposed.
    (b) The findings of fact shall include a finding on each of the 
following issues:
    (1) Whether the allegations in the complaint are true, and, if so, 
whether respondent's actions identified in the complaint violated the 
law;
    (2) Whether any affirmative defenses are meritorious; and
    (3) If the respondent is liable for penalties or assessments, the 
appropriate amount of any such penalties or assessments, considering any 
mitigating or aggravating factors that he or she finds in the case.
    (c) The presiding officer shall serve the initial decision or the 
decision granting summary decision on all parties within 90 days after 
the time for submission of posthearing briefs and responsive briefs (if 
permitted) has expired. If the presiding officer believes that he or she 
cannot meet the 90-day deadline, he or she shall notify the Commissioner 
of Food and Drugs or other entity designated by the Commissioner to 
decide the appeal of the reason(s) therefor, and the Commissioner or 
that entity may then set a new deadline.
    (d) Unless the initial decision or the decision granting summary 
decision of the presiding officer is timely appealed, the initial 
decision or the decision granting summary decision shall constitute the 
final decision of FDA and shall be final and binding on the parties 30 
days after it is issued by the presiding officer.



Sec.  17.47  Appeals.

    (a) Either the Center or any respondent may appeal an initial 
decision, including a decision not to withdraw a default judgment, or a 
decision granting summary decision to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
or other entity the Commissioner designates to decide the appeal. The 
Commissioner has currently designated the Departmental Appeals Board 
(DAB) to decide appeals under this part. Parties may appeal to the DAB 
by filing a notice of appeal with the DAB, Appellate Division MS6127, 
Departmental Appeals Board, United States Department of Health and Human 
Services, 330 Independence Ave. SW., Cohen Bldg., rm. G-644, Washington, 
DC 20201, and the Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and 
Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852, 
in accordance with this section.
    (b)(1) A notice of appeal may be filed at any time within 30 days 
after the presiding officer issues an initial decision or decision 
granting summary decision.
    (2) The Commissioner or the entity designated by the Commissioner to 
hear appeals may, within his or her discretion, extend the initial 30-
day period for an additional period of time if the Center or any 
respondent files a request for an extension within the initial 30-day 
period and shows good cause.
    (c) A notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a written brief of no 
greater length than that allowed for the posthearing brief. The notice 
must identify specific exceptions to the initial decision, must support 
each exception with citations to the record, and must explain the basis 
for each exception.
    (d) The opposing party may file a brief of no greater length than 
that allowed for the posthearing brief in opposition to exceptions 
within 30 days of receiving the notice of appeal and accompanying brief, 
unless such time period is extended by the Commissioner or the entity 
designated by the Commissioner to hear appeals on request of the 
opposing party for good cause

[[Page 247]]

shown. Any brief in opposition to exceptions shall be filed with the 
Division of Dockets Management and the DAB (addresses above).
    (e) The appellant may file a reply brief not more than 10 pages in 
length within 10 days of being served with appellee's brief.
    (f) There is no right to appear personally before the Commissioner 
of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the appeal (currently the 
DAB).
    (g) The entity deciding the appeal will consider only those issues 
raised before the presiding officer, except that the appellee may make 
any argument based on the record in support of the initial decision or 
decision granting summary decision.
    (h) If on appeal the entity deciding the appeal considers issues not 
adequately briefed by the parties, the entity may ask for additional 
briefing. However, no such additional briefs will be considered unless 
so requested.
    (i) If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the entity 
deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) that additional evidence not 
presented at the hearing is relevant and material and that there were 
reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence at the 
hearing, the entity deciding the appeal may remand the matter to the 
presiding officer for consideration of the additional evidence.
    (j) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other entity deciding the 
appeal (currently the DAB) will issue a decision on the appeal within 60 
days, if practicable, of the due date for submission of the appellee's 
brief. In the decision, the entity deciding the appeal may decline to 
review the case, affirm the initial decision or decision granting 
summary decision (with or without an opinion), or reverse the initial 
decision or decision granting summary decision, or increase, reduce, 
reverse, or remand any civil money penalty determined by the presiding 
officer in the initial decision. If the entity deciding the appeal 
declines to review the case, the initial decision or the decision 
granting summary decision shall constitute the final decision of FDA and 
shall be final and binding on the parties 30 days after the declination 
by the entity deciding the appeal.
    (k) The standard of review on a disputed issue of fact is whether 
the initial decision is supported by substantial evidence on the whole 
record. The standard of review on a disputed issue of law is whether the 
initial decision is erroneous.

[60 FR 38626, July 27, 1995, as amended at 71 FR 5979, Feb. 6, 2006]



Sec.  17.48  Harmless error.

    No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence, and 
no error or defect in any ruling or order or in any act done or omitted 
by the presiding officer or by any of the parties is grounds for 
vacating, modifying, or otherwise disturbing an otherwise appropriate 
ruling or order or act, unless refusal to take such action appears to 
the presiding officer or the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or other 
entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) to be inconsistent with 
substantial justice. The presiding officer and the entity deciding the 
appeal at every stage of the proceeding will disregard any error or 
defect in the proceeding that does not affect the substantial rights of 
the parties.



Sec.  17.51  Judicial review.

    (a) The final decision of the Commissioner of Food and Drugs or 
other entity deciding the appeal (currently the DAB) constitutes final 
agency action from which a respondent may petition for judicial review 
under the statutes governing the matter involved. Although the filing of 
a petition for judicial review does not stay a decision under this part, 
a respondent may file a petition for stay of such decision under Sec.  
10.35 of this chapter.
    (b) The Chief Counsel of FDA has been designated by the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services as the officer on whom copies of petitions for 
judicial review are to be served. This officer is responsible for filing 
the record on which the final decision is based. The record of the 
proceeding is certified by the entity deciding the appeal (currently the 
DAB).
    (c) Exhaustion of an appeal to the entity deciding the appeal 
(currently the DAB) is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial review.

Sec.  17.54  Deposit in the Treasury of the United States.

    All amounts assessed pursuant to this part shall be delivered to the 
Director, Division of Financial Management (HFA-100), Food and Drug 
Administration, rm. 11-61, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, and 
shall be deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the

performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.
    4. Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical ways of 
getting tasks accomplished.
    5. Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors 
or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and never 
accept, for himself or his family, favors or benefits under 
circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as 
influencing the performance of his governmental duties.
    6. Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the duties of 
office, since a Government employee has no private word which can be 
binding on public duty.
    7. Engage in no business with the Government, either directly or 
indirectly, which is inconsistent with the conscientious performance of 
his governmental duties.
    8. Never use any information coming to him confidentially in the 
performance of governmental duties as a means for making private profit.
    9. Expose corruption wherever discovered.
    10. Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public office is a 
public trust.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration will make the fullest possible 
disclosure of records to the public, consistent with the rights of 
individuals to privacy, the property rights of persons in trade secrets 
and confidential commercial or financial information, and the need for 
the agency to promote frank internal policy deliberations and to pursue 
its regulatory activities without disruption.
    (b) Except where specifically exempt pursuant to the provisions of 
this part, all Food and Drug Administration records shall be made 
available for public disclosure.
    (c) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, all 
nonexempt records shall be made available for public disclosure upon 
request regardless whether any justification or need for such records 
have been shown.
    (d) Under Sec.  21.71 of this chapter, a statement of the purposes 
to which the record requested is to be put, and a certification that the 
record will be so used, may be requested when:
    (1) The requested record is contained in a Privacy Act Record System 
as defined in Sec.  21.3(c) of this chapter;
    (2) The requester is a person other than the individual who is the 
subject of the record that is so retrieved or a person acting on his 
behalf; and
    (3) The disclosure is one that is discretionary, i.e., not required 
under this part.
    (e) ``Record'' and any other term used in this section in reference 
to information includes any information that would be an agency record 
subject to the requirements of this part when maintained by the agency 
in any format, including an electronic format.

this chapter for section 305 hearing records, in Sec.  20.80(b)

[[Page 253]]

System, as defined in Sec.  21.3(c) of this chapter, shall be subject to 
the special requirements of part 21 of this chapter. Disclosure of such 
a record to an individual who is the subject of the record does not 
invoke the rule established in this section that such records shall be 
made available for disclosure to all members of the public.

    (a) If a record contains both disclosable and nondisclosable 
information, the nondisclosable information will be deleted and the

disclosable information would compromise or impinge upon the 
nondisclosable portion of the record.
    (b)(1) Whenever information is deleted from a record that contains 
both disclosable and nondisclosable information, the amount of 
information deleted shall be indicated on the portion of the record that 
is made available, unless including that indication would harm an 
interest protected by an exemption under the Freedom of Information Act.
    (2) When technically feasible, the amount of information deleted 
shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is 
made.

made in writing by mailing or delivering the request to the Freedom of 
Information Staff at the address on the agency's web site at http://
www.fda.gov or by faxing it to the fax number listed on the agency's web 
site at http://www.fda.gov. All requests must contain the postal address 
and telephone number of the requester and the name of the person 
responsible for payment of any fees that may be charged.
    (b) A request for Food and Drug Administration records shall 
reasonably describe the records being sought, in a way that they can be 
identified and located. A request should include all pertinent details 
that will help identify the records sought.
    (1) If the description is insufficient to locate the records 
requested, the Food and Drug Administration will so notify the person 
making the request and indicate the additional information needed to 
identify the records requested.
    (2) Every reasonable effort shall be made by the Food and Drug 
Administration to assist in the identification and location of the 
records sought.
    (c) Upon receipt of a request for records, the Division of Freedom 
of Information shall enter it in a public log. The log shall state the 
date received, the name of the person making the request, the nature of 
the record requested, the action taken on the request, the date of 
determination letter sent pursuant to Sec.  20.41(b), and the date(s) 
any records are subsequently furnished.
    (d) A request by an individual, as defined in Sec.  21.3(a) of this 
chapter, for a record about himself shall be subject to:
    (1) The special requirements of part 21 of this chapter (the privacy 
regulations), and not to the provisions of this subpart, if the record 
requested is retrieved by the individual's name or other personal 
identifier and is contained in a Privacy Act Record System, as defined 
in Sec.  21.3(c) of this chapter.
    (2) The provisions of this subpart if the record requested is not 
retrieved by the individual's name or other personal identifier, whether 
or not the record is contained in a Privacy Act Record System.

Sec.  20.41  Time limitations.

    (a) All time limitations prescribed pursuant to this section shall 
begin as of the time at which a request for records is logged in by the 
Division of Freedom of Information pursuant to Sec.  20.40(c). An oral 
request for records

[[Page 256]]

shall not begin any time requirement. A written request for records sent 
elsewhere within the agency shall not begin any time requirement until 
it is redirected to the Division of Freedom of Information and is logged 
in there in accordance with Sec.  20.40(c).
    (b) Within 20 working days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
public holidays) after a request for records is logged in at the 
Division of Freedom of Information, the agency shall send a letter to 
the requester providing the agency's determination as to whether, or the 
extent to which, the agency will comply with the request, and, if any 
records are denied, the reasons for the denial.
    (1) If all of the records requested have been located and a final 
determination has been made with respect to disclosure of all of the 
records requested, the letter shall so state.
    (2) If all of the records have not been located or a final 
determination has not yet been made with respect to disclosure of all of 
the records requested, e.g., because it is necessary to consult the 
person affected pursuant to Sec.  20.47, the letter shall state the 
extent to which the records involved shall be disclosed pursuant to the 
rules established in this part.
    (3)(i) In unusual circumstances, the agency may extend the time for 
sending the letter for an additional period.
    (A) The agency may provide for an extension of up to 10 working days 
by providing written notice to the requester setting out the reasons for 
the extension and the date by which a determination is expected to be 
sent.
    (B) The agency may provide for an extension of more than 10 working 
days by providing written notice to the requester setting out the 
reasons for the extension. The notice also will give the requester an 
opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be 
processed in a shorter time and/or an opportunity to agree on a 
timeframe longer than the 10 extra working days for processing the 
request.
    (ii) Unusual circumstances may exist under any of the following 
conditions:
    (A) There is a need to search for and collect the requested records 
from field facilities or other components that are separate from the 
agency component responsible for processing the request;
    (B) There is a need to search for, collect, and appropriately 
examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records that are 
demanded in a single request; or
    (C) There is need for consultation, which shall be conducted with 
all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest 
in the determination of the request, or among two or more components of 
the Food and Drug Administration having substantial subject-matter 
interest in the determination.
    (4) If any record is denied, the letter shall state the right of the 
person requesting such records to appeal any adverse determination to 
the Assistant Secretary for Health, Department of Health and Human 
Services, in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR 5.34.
    (c) The Food and Drug Administration shall provide a determination 
of whether to provide expedited processing within 10 calendar days of 
receipt by the Division of Freedom of Information of the request and the 
required documentation of compelling need in accordance with Sec.  
20.44(b).

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8456, Jan. 27, 1981; 55 
FR 1405, Jan. 16, 1990; 59 FR 533, Jan. 5, 1994; 68 FR 25285, May 12, 
2003; 76 FR 31469, June 1, 2011]



Sec.  20.42  Aggregation of certain requests.

    The Food and Drug Administration may aggregate certain requests by 
the same requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, if 
the requests involve clearly related matters and the agency reasonably 
believes that such requests actually constitute a single request which 
would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in Sec.  
20.41(b)(3)(ii)(B). FDA may extend the time for processing aggregated 
requests in accordance with the unusual circumstances provisions of 
Sec.  20.41.

[68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.43  Multitrack processing.

    (a) Each Food and Drug Administration component is responsible for 
determining whether to use a multitrack system to process requests for 
records

[[Page 257]]

maintained by that component. A multitrack system provides two or more 
tracks for processing requests, based on the amount of work and/or time 
required for a request to be processed. The availability of multitrack 
processing does not affect expedited processing in accordance with Sec.  
20.44.
    (b) If multitrack processing is not adopted by a particular agency 
component, that component will process all requests in a single track, 
ordinarily on a first-in, first-out basis.
    (c) If a multitrack processing system is established by a particular 
agency component, that component may determine how many tracks to 
establish and the specific criteria for assigning requests to each 
track. Multiple tracks may be established for requests based on the 
amount of work and/or time required for a request to be processed.
    (d) Requests assigned to a given track will ordinarily be processed 
on a first-in, first-out basis within that track.
    (e) If a request does not qualify for the fastest processing track, 
the requester may be provided an opportunity to limit the scope of the 
request in order to qualify for faster processing.

[68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.44  Expedited processing.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration will provide expedited 
processing of a request for records when the requester demonstrates a 
compelling need, or in other cases as determined by the agency. A 
compelling need exists when:
    (1) A failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis 
could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or 
physical safety of an individual; or
    (2) With respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in 
disseminating information, there is a demonstrated urgency to inform the 
public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.
    (b) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(1) 
of this section must be made by the specific individual who is subject 
to an imminent threat, or by a family member, medical or health care 
professional, or other authorized representative of the individual, and 
must demonstrate a reasonable basis for concluding that failure to 
obtain the requested records on an expedited basis could reasonably be 
expected to pose a specific and identifiable imminent threat to the life 
or safety of the individual.
    (c) A request for expedited processing made under paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section must demonstrate that:
    (1) The requester is primarily engaged in disseminating information 
to the general public and not merely to a narrow interest group;
    (2) There is an urgent need for the requested information and that 
it has a particular value that will be lost if not obtained and 
disseminated quickly; however, a news media publication or broadcast 
deadline alone does not qualify as an urgent need, nor does a request 
for historical information; and
    (3) The request for records specifically concerns identifiable 
operations or activities of the Federal Government.
    (d) All requests for expedited processing shall be filed in writing 
as provided by Sec.  20.40. Each such request shall include information 
that demonstrates a reasonable basis for concluding that a compelling 
need exists within the meaning of paragraph (a) of this section and a 
certification that the information provided in the request is true and 
correct to the best of the requester's knowledge and belief. Any 
statements made in support of a request for expedited processing are 
subject to the False Reports to the Government Act (18 U.S.C. 1001).
    (e) The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee) 
will determine whether to grant a request for expedited processing 
within 10 days of receipt by the Division of Freedom of Information of 
all information required to make a decision.
    (f) If the agency grants a request for expedited processing, the 
agency shall process the request as soon as practicable.
    (g) If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the 
agency shall process the request with other nonexpedited requests.
    (h) If the agency denies a request for expedited processing, the 
requester

[[Page 258]]

may appeal the agency's decision by writing to the official identified 
in the denial letter.

[68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003, as amended at 76 FR 31469, June 1, 2011]



Sec.  20.45  Fees to be charged.

    (a) Categories of requests. Paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) of this 
section state, for each category of request, the type of fees that the 
Food and Drug Administration will generally charge. However, for each of 
these categories, the fees may be limited, waived, or reduced for the 
reasons given in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and in Sec.  
20.46 or for other reasons.
    (1) Commercial use request. If the request is for a commercial use, 
the Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of search, 
review, and duplication.
    (2) Educational and scientific institutions and news media. If the 
request is from an educational institution or a noncommercial scientific 
institution, operated primarily for scholarly or scientific research, or 
a representative of the news media, and the request is not for a 
commercial use, the Food and Drug Administration will charge only for 
the duplication of documents. Also, the Food and Drug Administration 
will not charge the copying costs for the first 100 pages of 
duplication.
    (3) Other requests. If the request is not the kind described in 
paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, then the Food and Drug 
Administration will charge only for the search and the duplication. 
Also, the Food and Drug Administration will not charge for the first 2 
hours of search time or for the copying costs of the first 100 pages of 
duplication.
    (b) General provisions. (1) The Food and Drug Administration may 
charge search fees even if the records found are exempt from disclosure 
or if no records are found.
    (2) If, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, there is no charge 
for the first 2 hours of search time, and those 2 hours are spent on a 
computer search, then the 2 free hours are the first 2 hours of the 
operator's own operation. If the operator spends less than 2 hours on 
the search, the total search fees will be reduced by the average hourly 
rate for the operator's time, multiplied by 2.
    (3) If, under paragraph (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, there is 
no charge for the first 100 pages of duplication, then those 100 pages 
are the first 100 pages of photocopies of standard size pages, or the 
first 100 pages of computer printout. If this method to calculate the 
fee reduction cannot be used, then the total duplication fee will be 
reduced by the normal charge for photocopying a standard size page, 
multiplied by 100.
    (4) No charge will be made if the costs of routine collection and 
processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the 
fee.
    (5) If it is determined that a requester (acting either alone or 
together with others) is breaking down a single request into a series of 
requests in order to avoid (or reduce) the fees charged, all these 
requests may be aggregated for purposes of calculating the fees charged.
    (6) Interest will be charged on unpaid bills beginning on the 31st 
day following the day the bill was sent. Provisions in 45 CFR part 30, 
the Department of Health and Human Services regulations governing claims 
collection, will be used in assessing interest, administrative costs, 
and penalties, and in taking actions to encourage payment.
    (c) Fee schedule. The Food and Drug Administration charges the 
following fees in accordance with the regulations of the Department of 
Health and Human Services at 45 CFR part 5.
    (1) Manual searching for or reviewing of records. When the search or 
review is performed by employees at grade GS-1 through GS-8, an hourly 
rate based on the salary of a GS-5, step 7, employee; when done by a GS-
9 through GS-14, an hourly rate based on the salary of a GS-12, step 4, 
employee; and when done by a GS-15 or above, an hourly rate based on the 
salary of a GS-15, step 7, employee. In each case, the hourly rate will 
be computed by taking the current hourly rate for the specified grade 
and step, adding 16 percent of that rate to cover benefits, and rounding 
to the nearest whole dollar. When a search involves employees at more 
than one of

[[Page 259]]

these levels, the Food and Drug Administration will charge the rate 
appropriate for each.
    (2) Computer searching and printing. The actual cost of operating 
the computer plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the 
rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (3) Photocopying standard size pages. $0.10 per page. Freedom of 
Information Officers may charge lower fees for particular documents 
where:
    (i) The document has already been printed in large numbers;
    (ii) The program office determines that using existing stock to 
answer this request, and any other anticipated Freedom of Information 
requests, will not interfere with program requirements; and
    (iii) The Freedom of Information Officer determines that the lower 
fee is adequate to recover the prorated share of the original printing 
costs.
    (4) Photocopying odd-size documents (such as punchcards or 
blueprints), or reproducing other records (such as tapes). The actual 
costs of operating the machine, plus the actual cost of the materials 
used, plus charges for the time spent by the operator, at the rates 
given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (5) Certifying that records are true copies. This service is not 
required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food and Drug 
Administration agrees to provide certification, there is a $10 charge 
per certification.
    (6) Sending records by express mail or other special methods. This 
service is not required by the Freedom of Information Act. If the Food 
and Drug Administration agrees to provide this service, the requester 
will be required to directly pay, or be directly charged by, the 
courier. The agency will not agree to any special delivery method that 
does not permit the requester to directly pay or be directly charged for 
the service.
    (7) Performing any other special service in connection with a 
request to which the Food and Drug Administration has agreed. Actual 
costs of operating any machinery, plus actual cost of any materials 
used, plus charges for the time of the Food and Drug Administration's 
employees, at the rates given in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.
    (d) Procedures for assessing and collecting fees--(1) Agreement to 
pay. The Food and Drug Administration generally assumes that a requester 
is willing to pay the fees charged for services associated with the 
request. The requester may specify a limit on the amount to be spent. If 
it appears that the fees will exceed the limit, the Food and Drug 
Administration will consult the requester to determine whether to 
proceed with the search.
    (2) Advance payment. If a requester has failed to pay previous bills 
in a timely fashion, or if the Food and Drug Administration's initial 
review of the request indicates that the charges will exceed $250, the 
requester will be required to pay past due fees and/or the estimated 
fees, or a deposit, before the search for the requested records begins. 
In such cases, the requester will be notified promptly upon receipt of 
the request, and the administrative time limits prescribed in Sec.  
20.41 will begin only after there is an agreement with the requester 
over payment of fees, or a decision that fee waiver or reduction is 
appropriate.
    (3) Billing and payment. Ordinarily, the requester will be required 
to pay all fees before the Food and Drug Administration will furnish the 
records. At its discretion, the Food and Drug Administration may send 
the requester a bill along with or following the records. For example, 
the Food and Drug Administration may do this if the requester has a 
history of prompt payment. The Food and Drug Administration may also, at 
its discretion, aggregate the charges for certain time periods in order 
to avoid sending numerous small bills to frequent requesters, or to 
businesses or agents representing requesters. For example, the Food and 
Drug Administration might send a bill to such a requester once a month. 
Fees should be paid in accordance with the instructions furnished by the 
person who responds to the request.

Sec.  20.46  Waiver or reduction of fees.

    (a) Standard. The Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or 
delegatee)

[[Page 260]]

will waive or reduce the fees that would otherwise be charged if 
disclosure of the information meets both of the following tests:
    (1) Is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute 
significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of 
the Government; and
    (2) It is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. 
These two tests are explained in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
    (b) Public interest. Disclosure of information satisfies the first 
test only if it furthers the specific public interest of being likely to 
contribute significantly to public understanding of Government 
operations or activities, regardless of any other public interest it may 
further. In analyzing this question, the Food and Drug Administration 
will consider the following factors:
    (1) Whether the records to be disclosed pertain to the operations or 
activities of the Federal Government;
    (2) Whether disclosure of the records would reveal any meaningful 
information about Government operations or activities that is not 
already public knowledge;
    (3) Whether disclosure will advance the understanding of the general 
public as distinguished from a narrow segment of interested persons. 
Under this factor, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether 
the requester is in a position to contribute to public understanding. 
For example, the Food and Drug Administration may consider whether the 
requester has such knowledge or expertise as may be necessary to 
understand the information, and whether the requester's intended use of 
the information would be likely to disseminate the information to the 
public. An unsupported claim to be doing research for a book or article 
does not demonstrate that likelihood, while such a claim by a 
representative of the news media is better evidence; and
    (4) Whether the contribution to public understanding will be a 
significant one, i.e., will the public's understanding of the 
Government's operations be substantially greater as a result of the 
disclosure.
    (c) Not primarily in the requester's commercial interest. If 
disclosure passes the test of furthering the specific public interest 
described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Food and Drug 
Administration will determine whether disclosure also furthers the 
requester's commercial interest and, if so, whether this effect 
outweighs the advancement of that public interest. In applying this 
second test, the Food and Drug Administration will consider the 
following factors:
    (1) Whether disclosure would further a commercial interest of the 
requester, or of someone on whose behalf the requester is acting. 
Commercial interests include interests relating to business, trade, and 
profit. Both profit and nonprofit-making corporations have commercial 
interests, as well as individuals, unions, and other associations. The 
interest of a representative of the news media in using the information 
for news dissemination purposes will not be considered a commercial 
interest.
    (2) If disclosure would further a commercial interest of the 
requester, whether that effect outweighs the advancement of the public 
interest as defined in paragraph (b) of this section.
    (d) Deciding between waiver and reduction. If the disclosure of the 
information requested passes both tests described in paragraphs (b) and 
(c) of this section, the Food and Drug Administration will normally 
waive fees. However, in some cases the Food and Drug Administration may 
decide only to reduce the fees. For example, the Food and Drug 
Administration may do this when disclosure of some but not all of the 
requested records passes the tests.
    (e) Procedure for requesting a waiver or reduction. A requester must 
request a waiver or reduction of fees at the same time as the request 
for records. The requester should explain why a waiver or reduction is 
proper under the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this 
section. Only the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs may make the 
decision whether to waive or reduce the fees. If the Food and Drug 
Administration does not completely grant the request for a waiver or 
reduction, the denial letter will designate a review official. The 
requester may appeal the denial to that official. The appeal letter 
should address reasons for

[[Page 261]]

the Associate Commissioner's decision that are set forth in the denial 
letter.

Sec.  20.47  Situations in which confidentiality is uncertain.

    In situations where the confidentiality of data or information is 
uncertain and there is a request for public disclosure, the Food and 
Drug Administration will consult with the person who has submitted or 
divulged the data or information or who would be affected by disclosure 
before determining whether or not such data or information is available 
for public disclosure.

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977. Redesignated at 68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.48  Judicial review of proposed disclosure.

    Where the Food and Drug Administration consults with a person who 
will be affected by a proposed disclosure of data or information 
contained in Food and Drug Administration records pursuant to Sec.  
20.47, and rejects the person's request that part or all of the records 
not be made available for public disclosure, the decision constitutes 
final agency action that is subject to judicial review pursuant to 5 
U.S.C. chapter 7. The person affected will be permitted 5 days after 
receipt of notification of such decision within which to institute suit 
in a United States District Court to enjoin release of the records 
involved. If suit is brought, the Food and Drug Administration will not 
disclose the records involved until the matter and all related appeals 
have been concluded.

25287, May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.49  Denial of a request for records.

    (a) A denial of a request for records, in whole or in part, shall be 
signed by the Assistant Commissioner for Public Affairs (or delegatee).
    (b) The name and title or position of each person who participated 
in the denial of a request for records shall be set forth in the letter 
denying the request. This requirement may be met by attaching a list of 
such individuals to the letter.
    (c) A letter denying a request for records, in whole or in part, 
shall state the reasons for the denial and shall state that an appeal 
may be made to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs 
(Media), Department of Health and Human Services. The agency will also 
make a reasonable effort to include in the letter an estimate of the 
volume of the records denied, unless providing such an estimate would 
harm an interest protected by an exemption under the Freedom of 
Information Act. This estimate will ordinarily be provided in terms of 
the approximate number of pages or some other reasonable measure. This 
estimate will not be provided if the volume of records denied is 
otherwise indicated through deletions on records disclosed in part.
    (d) Minor deletions of nondisclosable data and information from 
disclosable records shall not be deemed to be a denial of a request for 
records.

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8457, Jan. 27, 1981; 55

May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.50  Nonspecific and overly burdensome requests.

    The Food and Drug Administration will make every reasonable effort 
to comply fully with all requests for disclosure of nonexempt records. 
Nonspecific requests or requests for a large number of documents that 
require the deployment of a substantial amount of agency man-hours to 
search for and compile will be processed taking into account the staff-
hours required, the tasks from which these resources must be diverted, 
the impact that this diversion will have upon the agency's consumer 
protection activities, and the public policy reasons justifying the 
requests. A decision on the processing of such a request for information 
shall be made after balancing the public benefit to be gained by the 
disclosure against the public loss that will result from diverting 
agency personnel from their other responsibilities. In any situation in 
which it is determined that a request for voluminous records would 
unduly burden and interfere with the operations of the Food and Drug 
Administration, the person making the request will be asked to be more 
specific

[[Page 262]]

and to narrow the request, and to agree on an orderly procedure for the 
production of the requested records, in order to satisfy the request 
without disproportionate adverse effects on agency operations.

Sec.  20.51  Referral to primary source of records.

    Upon receipt of a request for a record or document which is 
contained in Food and Drug Administration files but which is available 
elsewhere at a lower cost, the person requesting the record or document 
shall be referred to the primary source of the record or document.

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977. Redesignated at 68 FR 25286, May 12, 2003]



Sec.  20.52  Availability of records at National Technical Information
Service.

    The Food and Drug Administration is furnishing a number of records 
to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal 
Rd., Springfield, VA 22162, which reproduces and distributes such 
information to the public at cost. A single copy of each such record 
shall be available for public review at the Food and Drug 
Administration. All persons requesting copies of such records shall be 
answered by referring the person requesting the records to NTIS.

Sec.  20.53  Use of private contractor for copying.

    The Food and Drug Administration may furnish requested records to a 
private contractor for copying after deletion of all nondisclosable data 
and information. Under these circumstances, the Food and Drug 
Administration will charge the person requesting the records for all of 
the fees involved pursuant to Sec.  20.45.

Sec.  20.54  Request for review without copying.

    (a) A person requesting disclosure of records shall be permitted an 
opportunity to review them without the necessity for copying them where 
the records involved contain only disclosable data and information. 
Under these circumstances, the Food and Drug Administration will charge 
only for the costs of searching for the records.
    (b) Where a request is made for review of records without copying, 
and the records involved contain both disclosable and nondisclosable 
information, the records containing nondisclosable information shall 
first be copied with the nondisclosable information blocked out and the 
Food and Drug Administration will charge for the costs of searching and 
copying.

Sec.  20.55  Indexing trade secrets and confidential commercial or
financial information.

    Whenever the Food and Drug Administration denies a request for a 
record or portion thereof on the grounds that the record or portion 
thereof is exempt from public disclosure as trade secret or confidential 
commercial or financial data and information under Sec.  20.61, and the 
person requesting the record subsequently contests the denial in the 
courts, the Food and Drug Administration will so inform the person 
affected, i.e., the person who submitted the record, and will require 
that such person intervene to defend the exempt status of the record. If 
a court requires the Food and Drug Administration to itemize and index 
such records, the Food and Drug Administration will so inform the person 
affected and will require that such person undertake the itemization and 
indexing of the records. If the affected person fails to intervene to 
defend the exempt status of the records and to itemize and index the 
disputed records, the Food and Drug Administration will take this 
failure into consideration in deciding whether that person has waived 
such exemption so as to require the Food and Drug Administration to 
promptly

[[Page 263]]

make the records available for public disclosure.

                          Subpart D_Exemptions



Sec.  20.60  Applicability of exemptions.

    (a) The exemptions established in this subpart shall apply to all 
Food and Drug Administration records, except as provided in subpart E of 
this part. Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily available for public 
disclosure in accordance with the provisions in subpart F of this part 
or of another regulation cross-referenced in Sec.  20.100(c) is not 
available for such disclosure to the extent that it falls within an 
exemption contained in this subpart, except as provided by the 
limitations on exemptions specified in subpart E of this part. For 
example, correspondence that is ordinarily disclosable under Sec.  
20.103 is not disclosable to the extent that it contains trade secrets 
exempt from disclosure under Sec.  20.61 and is not subject to 
discretionary release under Sec.  20.82.
    (b) Where application of one or more exemptions results in a record 
being disclosable in part and nondisclosable in part, the rule 
established in Sec.  20.22 shall apply.



Sec.  20.61  Trade secrets and commercial or financial information
which is privileged or confidential.

    (a) A trade secret may consist of any commercially valuable plan, 
formula, process, or device that is used for the making, preparing, 
compounding, or processing of trade commodities and that can be said to 
be the end product of either innovation or substantial effort. There 
must be a direct relationship between the trade secret and the 
productive process.
    (b) Commercial or financial information that is privileged or 
confidential means valuable data or information which is used in one's 
business and is of a type customarily held in strict confidence or 
regarded as privileged and not disclosed to any member of the public by 
the person to whom it belongs.
    (c) Data and information submitted or divulged to the Food and Drug 
Administration which fall within the definitions of a trade secret or 
confidential commercial or financial information are not available for 
public disclosure.
    (d) A person who submits records to the Government may designate 
part or all of the information in such records as exempt from disclosure 
under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. The person may make 
this designation either at the time the records are submitted to the 
Government or within a reasonable time thereafter. The designation must 
be in writing. Where a legend is required by a request for proposals or 
request for quotations, pursuant to 48 CFR 352.215-12, then that legend 
is necessary for this purpose. Any such designation will expire 10 years 
after the records were submitted to the Government.
    (e) The procedures in this paragraph apply to records on which the 
submitter has designated information as provided in paragraph (d) of 
this section. These procedures also apply to records that were submitted 
to the Food and Drug Administration when the agency has substantial 
reason to believe that information in the records could reasonably be 
considered exempt under exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act. 
Certain exceptions to these procedures are set forth in paragraph (f) of 
this section.
    (1) When the Food and Drug Administration receives a request for 
such records and determines that disclosure may be required, the Food 
and Drug Administration will make reasonable efforts to notify the 
submitter about these facts. The notice will include a copy of the 
request, and it will inform the submitter about the procedures and time 
limits for submission and consideration of objections to disclosure. If 
the Food and Drug Administration must notify a large number of 
submitters, notification may be done by posting or publishing a notice 
in a place where the submitters are reasonably likely to become aware of 
it.
    (2) The submitter has 5 working days from receipt of the notice to 
object to disclosure of any part of the records and to state all bases 
for its objections.
    (3) The Food and Drug Administration will give consideration to all 
bases

[[Page 264]]

that have been stated in a timely manner by the submitter. If the Food 
and Drug Administration decides to disclose the records, the Food and 
Drug Administration will notify the submitter in writing. This notice 
will briefly explain why the agency did not sustain the submitter's 
objections. The Food and Drug Administration will include with the 
notice a copy of the records about which the submitter objected, as the 
agency proposes to disclose them. The notice will state that the Food 
and Drug Administration intends to disclose the records 5 working days 
after the submitter receives the notice unless a U.S. District Court 
orders the agency not to release them.
    (4) If a requester files suit under the Freedom of Information Act 
to obtain records covered by this paragraph, the Food and Drug 
Administration will promptly notify the submitter.
    (5) Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a 
submitter under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the Food and Drug 
Administration will notify the requester that the Food and Drug 
Administration is giving the submitter a notice and an opportunity to 
object. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration sends a notice to a 
submitter under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the Food and Drug 
Administration will notify the requester of this fact.
    (f) The notice requirements in paragraph (e) of this section do not 
apply in the following situations:
    (1) The Food and Drug Administration decided not to disclose the 
records;
    (2) The information has previously been published or made generally 
available;
    (3) Disclosure is required by a regulation issued after notice and 
opportunity for public comment, that specifies narrow categories of 
records that are to be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, 
but in this case a submitter may still designate records as described in 
paragraph (d) of this section, and in exceptional cases, the Food and 
Drug Administration may, at its discretion, follow the notice procedures 
in paragraph (e) of this section;
    (4) The information requested has not been designated by the 
submitter as exempt from disclosure when the submitter had an 
opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or 
within a reasonable time thereafter, unless the Food and Drug 
Administration has substantial reason to believe that disclosure of the 
information would result in competitive harm; or
    (5) The designation appears to be obviously frivolous, but in this 
case the Food and Drug Administration will still give the submitter the 
written notice required by paragraph (e)(3) of this section (although 
this notice need not explain our decision or include a copy of the 
records), and the Food and Drug Administration will notify the requester 
as described in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 59 FR 535, Jan. 5, 1994]



Sec.  20.62  Inter- or intra-agency memoranda or letters.

    All communications within the Executive Branch of the Federal 
government which are in written form or which are subsequently reduced 
to writing may be withheld from public disclosure except that factual 
information which is reasonably segregable in accordance with the rule 
established in Sec.  20.22 is available for public disclosure.



Sec.  20.63  Personnel, medical, and similar files, disclosure of 
which constitutes a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

    (a) The names or other information which would identify patients or 
research subjects in any medical or similar report, test, study, or 
other research project shall be deleted before the record is made 
available for public disclosure.
    (b) The names and other information which would identify patients or 
research subjects should be deleted from any record before it is 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration. If the Food and Drug 
Administration subsequently needs the names of such individuals, a 
separate request will be made.
    (c) Requests for deletion of business or product names prior to 
disclosure of any record to the public shall not be granted on the 
ground of privacy, but such deletion may be justified under

[[Page 265]]

another exemption established in this subpart, e.g., the exemption for 
trade secrets and confidential commercial or financial information under 
Sec.  20.61.
    (d) Names of individuals conducting investigations, studies, or 
tests on products or ingredients shall not be deleted prior to 
disclosure of any record to the public unless extraordinary 
circumstances are shown.
    (e) A request for all records relating to a specific individual will 
be denied as a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy unless 
accompanied by the written consent of the individual named.
    (f) The names and any information that would identify the voluntary 
reporter or any other person associated with an adverse event involving 
a human drug, biologic, or medical device product shall not be disclosed 
by the Food and Drug Administration or by a manufacturer in possession 
of such reports in response to a request, demand, or order. Information 
that would identify the voluntary reporter or persons identified in the 
report includes, but is not limited to, the name, address, institution, 
or any other information that would lead to the identities of the 
reporter or persons identified in a report. This provision does not 
affect disclosure of the identities of reporters required by a Federal 
statute or regulation to make adverse event reports. Disclosure of the 
identities of such reporters is governed by the applicable Federal 
statutes and regulations.
    (1) Exceptions. (i) Identities may be disclosed if both the 
voluntary reporter and the person identified in an adverse event report 
or that person's legal representative consent in writing to disclosure, 
but neither FDA nor any manufacturer in possession of such reports shall 
be required to seek consent for disclosure from the voluntary reporter 
or the person identified in the adverse event report or that person's 
legal representative; or
    (ii) Identities of the voluntary reporter and the person who 
experienced the reported adverse event may be disclosed pursuant to a 
court order in the course of medical malpractice litigation involving 
both parties; or (iii) The report, excluding the identities of any other 
individuals, shall be disclosed to the person who is the subject of the 
report upon request.
    (2) Preemption. No State or local governing entity shall establish 
or continue in effect any law, rule, regulation, or other requirement 
that permits or requires disclosure of the identities of the voluntary 
reporter or other person identified in an adverse event report except as 
provided in this section.

[42 FR 15616, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 60 FR 16968, Apr. 3, 1995]



Sec.  20.64  Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes.

    (a) Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes may 
be withheld from public disclosure pursuant to the provisions of this 
section to the extent that disclosure of such records or information:
    (1) Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement 
proceedings;
    (2) Would deprive a person to a right to a fair trial or an 
impartial adjudication;
    (3) Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted 
invasion of personal privacy;
    (4) Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a 
confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or 
authority or any private institution which furnished information on a 
confidential basis; and information furnished by a confidential source 
in the case of a record compiled by the Food and Drug Administration or 
any other criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal 
investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security 
intelligence investigation;
    (5) Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement 
investigations or prosecutions or would disclose guidelines for law 
enforcement investigations or prosecutions, if such disclosure could 
reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or
    (6) Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical 
safety of any individual.
    (b) Records include all records relating to regulatory enforcement 
action, including both administrative and

[[Page 266]]

court action, which have not been disclosed to any member of the public, 
including any person who is the subject of the investigation.
    (c) Any record which is disclosed to any person, including any 
person who is the subject of a Food and Drug Administration 
investigation, and any data or information received from any person who 
is the subject of a Food and Drug Administration investigation relating 
to such investigation, is available for public disclosure at that time 
in accordance with the rule established in Sec.  20.21, except that:
    (1) Disclosure of such records shall be subject to the other 
exemptions established in this subpart and to the limitations on 
exemptions established in subpart E of this part.
    (2) The record of a section 305 hearing shall be available for 
public disclosure only in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  7.87 
of this chapter.
    (d) Records for law enforcement purposes shall be subject to the 
following rules:
    (1) No such record is available for public disclosure prior to the 
consideration of regulatory enforcement action based upon that record's 
being closed, except as provided in Sec.  20.82. The Commissioner will 
exercise his discretion to disclose records relating to possible 
criminal prosecution pursuant to Sec.  20.82 prior to consideration of 
criminal prosecution being closed only very rarely and only under 
circumstances that demonstrate a compelling public interest.
    (2) After the consideration of regulatory enforcement action is 
closed, such records shall be made available for public disclosure 
except to the extent that other exemptions from disclosure in this 
subpart are applicable. No statements of witnesses obtained through 
promises of confidentiality are available for public disclosure.
    (3) The consideration of regulatory enforcement action based upon a 
particular record shall be deemed to be closed within the meaning of 
this section:
    (i) If it relates to administrative action, when a final decision 
has been made not to take such action or such action has been taken and 
the matter has been concluded.
    (ii) If it relates to court action, when a final decision has been 
made not to recommend such action to a United States attorney based upon 
that record, or a recommendation has been finally refused by a United 
States attorney, or court action has been instituted and the matter and 
all related appeals have been concluded, or the statute of limitations 
runs.
    (iii) If it relates to both administrative and court action, when 
the events described in both paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this 
section have occurred.
    (4) Prior to disclosure of any record specifically reflecting 
consideration of possible criminal prosecution of any individual, all 
names and other information that would identify an individual who was 
considered for criminal prosecution but who was not prosecuted shall be 
deleted unless the Commissioner concludes that there is a compelling 
public interest in the disclosure of such names.
    (e) Names and other information that would identify a Food and Drug 
Administration employee shall be deleted from records prior to public 
disclosure only pursuant to Sec.  20.32.

Sec.  20.65  National defense and foreign policy.

    (a) Records or information may be withheld from public disclosure if 
they are:
    (1) Specifically authorized under criteria established by an 
Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or 
foreign policy; and
    (2) In fact properly classified under such Executive order.
    (b) [Reserved]

[70 FR 41958, July 21, 2005]



Sec.  20.66  Internal personnel rules and practices.

    Records or information may be withheld from public disclosure if 
they are related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Under this exemption, FDA may 
withhold records or information about routine internal agency practices 
and procedures. Under this exemption, the agency may also

[[Page 267]]

withhold internal records whose release would help some persons 
circumvent the law.

[70 FR 41958, July 21, 2005]



Sec.  20.67  Records exempted by other statutes.

    Records or information may be withheld from public disclosure if a 
statute specifically allows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to 
withhold them. FDA may use another statute to justify withholding 
records and information only if it absolutely prohibits disclosure, sets 
forth criteria to guide our decision on releasing material, or 
identifies particular types of matters to be withheld.

                   Subpart E_Limitations on Exemptions



Sec.  20.80  Applicability of limitations on exemptions.

    (a) The limitations on exemptions established in this subpart shall 
apply to all Food and Drug Administration records, except as 
specifically provided herein. Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily 
exempt from public disclosure in accordance with the provisions in 
subpart D of this part is available for such disclosure to the extent 
that it falls within a limitation on the exemption contained in this 
subpart. For example, an investigatory record that is ordinarily exempt 
from disclosure under Sec.  20.64 is disclosable to Congress in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec.  20.87.
    (b) Disclosure of a record to any member of the public pursuant to 
the provisions in Sec.  20.81, data and information previously disclosed 
to the public, in Sec.  20.82, discretionary disclosure by the 
Commissioner, and in Sec.  20.83, disclosure pursuant to a court order, 
shall involve the rule established in Sec.  20.21 that the record shall 
be made available for disclosure to all members of the public who 
request it. Disclosure of a record only to the limited categories of 
persons and under the conditions specified in Sec.  20.84, special 
government employees, in Sec.  20.85, other Federal government 
departments and agencies, in Sec.  20.86, in camera disclosure in 
administrative or court proceedings, in Sec.  20.87(b), Congress, in 
Sec.  20.88, State and local government officials, in Sec.  20.89, 
foreign government officials, and in Sec.  20.90, contractors, which 
does not result in disclosure of the record to any member of the public 
in an authorized manner, shall not invoke the rule established in Sec.  
20.21.
    (c) Disclosure to government employees and special government 
employees of records exempt from public disclosure shall subject those 
persons to the same restrictions with respect to the disclosure of such 
records as any Food and Drug Administration employee.
    (d) In the case of a record in a Privacy Act Record System, as 
defined in Sec.  21.3(c) of this chapter:
    (1) The availability to an individual, as defined in Sec.  21.3(a), 
of a record about himself that is retrieved by the individual's name or 
other personal identifier and is contained in a Privacy Act Record 
System shall be subject to the special requirements of part 21 of this 
chapter (the privacy regulations) and shall not be subject to the 
exemptions in subpart D of this part except that where the system is 
exempt and the requested record is not available under Sec.  21.61 of 
this chapter, the provisions of this part shall apply.
    (2) The availability of a record about an individual to persons 
other than the individual who is the subject of the record shall be 
subject to the special requirements of part 21, subpart G, of this 
chapter (restrictions on disclosure in the privacy regulations), and 
shall not be subject to the limitations on exemptions in this subpart 
except as provided in part 21, subpart G, of this chapter.



Sec.  20.81  Data and information previously disclosed to the public.

    (a) Any Food and Drug Administration record that is otherwise exempt 
from public disclosure pursuant to subpart D of this part is available 
for public disclosure to the extent that it contains data or information 
that have previously been disclosed in a lawful manner to any member of 
the public, other than an employee or consultant or pursuant to other 
commerical arrangements with appropriate safeguards for secrecy.

[[Page 268]]

    (1) For purposes of this section, an individual shall be deemed to 
be a consultant only if disclosure of the information was necessary in 
order to perform that specific consulting service and the purpose of the 
disclosure was solely to obtain that service. The number of consultants 
who have received such information shall have been limited to the number 
reasonably needed to perform that particular consulting service.
    (2) For purposes of this section, other commercial arrangements 
shall include licenses, contracts, and similar legal relationships 
between business associates.
    (3) For purposes of this section, data and information disclosed to 
clinical investigators or members of institutional review committees, 
whether required by regulations of the Food and Drug Administration, or 
made voluntarily, if accompanied by appropriate safeguards to assure 
secrecy and otherwise in accordance with this section, are not deemed to 
have been previously disclosed to any member of the public within the 
meaning of paragraph (a) of this section.
    (b) Any statement relating to prior public disclosure is subject to 
the False Reports to the Government Act, 18 U.S.C. 1001.

Sec.  20.82  Discretionary disclosure by the Commissioner.

    (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the 
Commissioner may, in his discretion, disclose part or all of any Food 
and Drug Administration record that is otherwise exempt from disclosure 
pursuant to subpart D of this part. The Commissioner shall exercise his 
discretion to disclose such records whenever he determines that such 
disclosure is in the public interest, will promote the objectives of the 
act and the agency, and is consistent with the rights of individuals to 
privacy, the property rights of persons in trade secrets, and the need 
for the agency to promote frank internal policy deliberations and to 
pursue its regulatory activities without disruption.
    (b) The Commissioner shall not make available for public disclosure 
any record that is:
    (1) Exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Sec.  20.61.
    (2) Exempt from public disclosure pursuant to Sec.  20.63.
    (3) Prohibited from public disclosure under statute.
    (4) Contained in a Privacy Act Record System where disclosure would 
constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy or is 
otherwise in violation of 5 U.S.C. 552a(b), as applied in part 21, 
subpart G, of this chapter (restrictions on disclosure in the privacy 
regulations).
    (c) Discretionary disclosure of a record pursuant to this section 
shall invoke the requirement that the record shall be disclosed to any 
person who requests it pursuant to Sec.  20.21, but shall not set a 
precedent for discretionary disclosure of any similar or related record 
and shall not obligate the Commissioner to exercise his discretion to 
disclose any other record that is exempt from disclosure.

Sec.  20.83  Disclosure required by court order.

    (a) Records of the Food and Drug Administration which the 
Commissioner has determined are not available for public disclosure, in 
the form of a regulation published or cross-referenced in this part, 
shall nevertheless be made available for public disclosure in compliance 
with a final court order requiring such disclosure.
    (b) Where the Food and Drug Administration record ordered disclosed 
under paragraph (a) of this section is a record about an individual that 
is not available for public disclosure under Sec.  20.63, the Food and 
Drug Administration shall attempt to notify the individual who is the 
subject of the record of the disclosure, by sending a notice to the 
individual's last known address.
    (c) Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply where the name or 
other personal identifying information is deleted prior to disclosure.

    Data and information otherwise exempt from public disclosure may be 
disclosed to Food and Drug Administration consultants, advisory 
committees, State and local government officials commissioned pursuant 
to 21 U.S.C. 372(a), and other special government employees for use only 
in their work with the Food and Drug Administration. Such persons are 
thereafter subject to the same restrictions with respect to the 
disclosure of such data and information as any other Food and Drug 
Administration employee.



Sec.  20.85  Disclosure to other Federal government departments 
and agencies.

    Any Food and Drug Administration record otherwise exempt from public 
disclosure may be disclosed to other Federal government departments and 
agencies, except that trade secrets and confidential commercial or 
financial information prohibited from disclosure by 21 U.S.C. 331(j), 21 
U.S.C. 360(j)(c), 42 U.S.C. 263g(d) and 42 U.S.C. 263i(e) may be

section shall be pursuant to a written agreement that the record shall 
not be further disclosed by the other department or agency except with 
the written permission of the Food and Drug Administration.

revealed in Food and Drug Administration administrative proceedings 
pursuant to parts 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 19 of this chapter or 
court proceedings, where data or information are relevant. The Food and

appropriate measures be taken, to reduce disclosure to the minimum 
necessary under the circumstances.

own use or on behalf of any constituent shall be subject to the same 
rules in this part that apply to any other member of the public.

status with respect to disclosure of Food and Drug Administration 
records as any special government employee.
    (b) Communications with State and local government officials with 
respect to law enforcement activities undertaken pursuant to a contract 
between the Food and Drug Administration and such officials shall be

Food and Drug Administration as part of cooperative law enforcement and 
regulatory efforts, shall be exempt from public disclosure to the same 
extent to which the records would be so exempt pursuant to Sec. Sec.  
20.61 and 20.64, as if they had been prepared by or submitted directly 
to Food and Drug Administration employees, except that investigatory 
records shall be exempt from disclosure for a longer period of time if 
the State or local government officials so require as a condition of

to State government officials as part of cooperative law enforcement or 
regulatory efforts, provided that:
    (i) The State government agency has provided both a written 
statement establishing its authority to protect confidential commercial 
information from public disclosure and a written commitment not to 
disclose any such information provided without the written permission of 
the sponsor or written confirmation by the Food and Drug Administration 
that the information no longer has confidential status; and
    (ii) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs or the Commissioner's 
designee makes one or more of the following determinations:
    (A) The sponsor of the product application has provided written 
authorization for the disclosure;
    (B) Disclosure would be in the interest of public health by reason 
of the State government's possessing information concerning the safety, 
effectiveness, or quality of a product or information concerning an 
investigation, or by reason of the State government being able to 
exercise its regulatory authority more expeditiously than the Food and 
Drug Administration; or
    (C) The disclosure is to a State government scientist visiting the 
Food and Drug Administration on the agency's premises as part of a joint 
review or long-term cooperative training effort authorized under section 
708 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act), the review is 
in the interest of public health, the Food and Drug Administration 
retains physical control over the information, the Food and Drug 
Administration requires the visiting State government scientist to sign 
a written commitment to protect the confidentiality of the information, 
and the visiting State government scientist provides a written assurance 
that he or she has no financial interest in the regulated industry of 
the type that would preclude participation in the review of the matter 
if the individual were subject to the conflict of interest rules 
applicable to the Food and Drug Administration advisory committee 
members under Sec.  14.80(b)(1) of this chapter. Subject to all the 
foregoing conditions, a visiting State government scientist may have 
access to trade secret information, entitled to protection under section 
301(j) of the act, in those cases where such disclosures would be a 
necessary part of the joint review or training.
    (2) Except as provided under paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(C) of this 
section, this provision does not authorize the disclosure to State 
government officials of trade secret information concerning

authorization provided by the submitter of the information.
    (3) Any disclosure under this section of information submitted to 
the Food and Drug Administration or incorporated into agency-prepared 
records does not invoke the rule established in

purpose, may authorize the disclosure to, or receipt from, an official 
of a State government agency of nonpublic, predecisional documents 
concerning the Food and Drug Administration's or the other government 
agency's regulations or other regulatory requirements, or other 
nonpublic information relevant to either agency's activities, as part of

activities, or implementation of Federal-State agreements, provided 
that:

nonpublic documents from public disclosure and will not disclose any 
such documents provided without the written confirmation by the Food and 
Drug Administration that the documents no longer have nonpublic status; 
and
    (ii) The Senior Associate Commissioner for Policy, Planning, and 
Legislation or the Deputy Commissioner for International and Constituent 
Relations or their designee makes the determination that the exchange is

standards and requirements in FDA's areas of responsibility. For such 
officials, the statement and commitment required by paragraph (e)(1)(i) 
of this section shall be provided by both the organization and the

any contractor shall be entered into before data and information 
otherwise exempt from public disclosure may be disclosed to the

for public disclosure at the time such disclosure is first made. Such 
records include correspondence with companies following factory 
inspection, recall or detention requests, notice of refusal of admission 
of an imported product, regulatory letters, information letters, Forms 
FD-483 and FD-2275 furnished to companies after factory inspection, and 
similar records.

for investigatory records established in Sec.  20.64, the Commissioner 
determines that they are subject to discretionary release pursuant to 
Sec.  20.82.
    (c) Records relating to administrative enforcement action that are 
not disclosed to any member of the public constitute investigatory 
records that are subject to the rules for disclosure established in 
Sec.  20.64. For example, an establishment inspection report is an 
investigatory record and thus subject to Sec.  20.64 except insofar as 
the Commissioner exercises his discretion to release it pursuant to 
Sec.  20.82.

    (a) All records and documents filed in the courts are available for 
public disclosure unless the court orders otherwise. The Food and Drug 
Administration will make available for public disclosure such records or 
documents if the agency can determine that it has an accurate copy of 
the actual record or document filed in the court. If the Food and Drug 
Administration cannot determine whether it has an accurate copy of such 
a record or document, the person requesting a copy shall be referred to 
the court involved.
    (b) After a recommendation for court action has been finally refused 
by a United States attorney, the correspondence with the United States 
attorney and the Department of Justice with respect to that 
recommendation, including the pleadings recommended for filing with the 
court, is available for public disclosure. Prior to disclosure of any 
record specifically reflecting consideration of possible criminal 
prosecution of any individual, all names and other information that 
would identify an individual who was considered for criminal prosecution 
but who was not prosecuted shall be deleted unless the Commissioner 
concludes that there is a compelling public

[[Page 276]]

interest in the disclosure of such names.



Sec.  20.103  Correspondence.

    (a) All correspondence to and from members of the public, members of 
Congress, organization or company officials, or other persons, except 
members of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government and special 
government employees, is available for public disclosure.
    (b) Any such correspondence is available for public disclosure at 
the time that it is sent or received by the Food and Drug Administration 
unless a different time for such disclosure is specified in other rules 
established or cross-referenced in this part, e.g., correspondence 
relating to an IND notice or an NDA in Sec.  314.430 of this chapter.

organization or company officials, or other persons, except members of 
the Executive Branch of the Federal government or special government 
employees, are available for public disclosure.
    (b) Any such summary is available for public disclosure at the time 
that it is prepared by the Food and Drug Administration unless a 
different time for such disclosure is specified in other rules 
established or cross-referenced in this part, e.g., summaries of oral 
discussions relating to a food additive petition in Sec.  171.1(h)(3) of 
this chapter.
    (c) If more than one summary of an oral discussion exists in a Food 
and Drug Administration file, all such summaries shall be disclosed in 
response to any request for such summary.

Administration of testing and research being conducted by or with funds 
provided by the Food and Drug Administration is available for public 
disclosure.
    (b) Any contract relating to agency testing and research, and any 
progress report relating thereto, is available for public disclosure.
    (c) The results of all testing or research conducted by or with 
funds provided by the Food and Drug Administration, such as 
toxicological testing, compliance assays, methodology studies, and 
product testing, are available for public disclosure when the final 
report is complete and accepted by the responsible Food and Drug 
Administration official, after deletion of any information that would 
reveal confidential investigative techniques and procedures, e.g., the 
use of ``markers'' to document adulteration of a product. If such 
results are disclosed in an authorized manner to any member of the 
public before the final report is available, they are immediately 
available for public disclosure to any member of the public who requests 
them.
    (d) Access to all raw data, slides, worksheets, and other similar 
working materials shall be provided at the same time that the final 
report is disclosed.

Sec.  21.1  Scope.

    (a) This part establishes procedures to implement the Privacy Act of 
1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). It applies to records about individuals that are 
maintained, collected, used, or disclosed by the Food and Drug 
Administration and contained in Privacy Act Record Systems.
    (b) This part does not:
    (1) Apply to Food and Drug Administration record systems that are 
not Privacy Act Record Systems or make available to an individual 
records that may include references to him but that are not retrieved by 
his name or other personal identifier, whether or not contained in a 
Privacy Act Record System. part 20 of this chapter (the public 
information regulations) and other regulations referred to therein 
determine when records are made available in such cases.
    (2) Make any records available to persons other than (i) individuals 
who are the subjects of the records, (ii) persons accompanying such 
individuals under Sec.  21.43, (iii) persons provided records pursuant 
to individual consent under Sec.  21.72, or (iv) persons acting on 
behalf of such individuals as legal guardians under Sec.  21.75. Part 20 
of this chapter (the public information regulations) and other 
regulations referred to therein determine when Food and Drug 
Administration records are disclosable to members of the public 
generally. Subpart G of this part limits the provisions of part 20 of 
this chapter with respect to disclosures of records about individuals 
from Privacy Act Record Systems to persons other than individuals who 
are the subjects of the records.
    (3) Make available information compiled by the Food and Drug 
Administration in reasonable anticipation of court litigation or formal 
administrative proceedings. The availability of such information to any 
member of the public, including any subject individual or party to such 
litigation or proceeding shall be governed by applicable constitutional 
principles, rules of discovery, and part 20 of this chapter (the public 
information regulations).
    (4) Apply to personnel records maintained by the Division of Human 
Resources Management, Food and Drug Administration, except as provided 
in Sec.  21.32. Such records are subject to regulations of the Office of 
Personnel Management in 5 CFR parts 293, 294, and 297.

FR 52278, Dec. 23, 1985]



Sec.  21.3  Definitions.

    As used in this part:
    (a) Individual means a natural living person who is a citizen of the 
United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. 
Individual does not include sole proprietorships, partnerships, or 
corporations engaged in the production or distribution of products 
regulated by the Food and Drug Administration or with which the Food and 
Drug Administration has business dealings. Any such business enterprise 
that is identified by the name of one or more individuals is not an 
individual within the meaning of this part. Employees of regulated 
business enterprises are considered individuals. Accordingly, physicians 
and other health professionals who are engaged in business as 
proprietors of establishments regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration are not considered individuals; however, physicians and 
other health professionals who are engaged in clinical investigations, 
employed by regulated enterprises, or the subjects of records concerning 
their own health, e.g., exposure to excessive radiation, are considered 
individuals. Food and Drug Administration employees, consultants, and 
advisory committee members, State and local officials, and consumers are 
considered individuals.

[[Page 283]]

    (b) Records about individuals means items, collections, or groupings 
of information about individuals contained in Privacy Act Record 
Systems, including, but not limited to education, financial 
transactions, medical history, criminal history, or employment history, 
that contain names or personal identifiers.
    (c) Privacy Act Record System means a system of records about 
individuals under the control of the Food and Drug Administration from 
which information is retrieved by individual names or other personal 
identifiers. The term includes such a system of records whether subject 
to a notice published by the Food and Drug Administration, the 
Department, or another agency. Where records are retrieved only by 
personal identifiers other than individual names, a system of records is 
not a Privacy Act Record System if the Food and Drug Administration 
cannot, by reference to information under its control, or by reference 
to records of contractors that are subject to this part under Sec.  
21.30, ascertain the identity of individuals who are the subjects of the 
records.
    (d) Personal identifiers includes individual names, identifying 
numbers, symbols, or other identifying designations assigned to 
individuals. Personal identifiers does not include names, numbers, 
symbols, or other identifying designations that identify products, 
establishments, or actions.
    (e) Personnel records means any personal information maintained in a 
Privacy Act Record System that is needed for personnel management 
programs or processes such as staffing, employee development, 
retirement, and grievances and appeals.
    (f) Department means Department of Health and Human Services.



Sec.  21.10  Policy concerning records about individuals.

    Information about individuals in Food and Drug Administration 
records shall be collected, maintained, used, and disseminated so as to 
protect the right to privacy of the individual to the fullest possible 
extent consistent with laws relating to disclosure of information to the 
general public, the law enforcement responsibilities of the agency, and 
administrative and program management needs.

    (6) The policies and practices of the Food and Drug Administration 
regarding storage, retrievability (i.e., how the records are indexed and

    (b) The Food and Drug Administration shall issue a notice, in 
accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and Sec.  21.20(b), of any 
change in a Privacy Act Record System which:
    (1) Increases the number or types of individuals about whom records 
are maintained;
    (2) Expands the type or amount of information about individuals that 
is maintained;
    (3) Increases the number of categories of agencies or other persons 
who may have access to those records;
    (4) Alters the manner in which the records are organized so as to 
change the nature or scope of those records, such as the combining of 
two or more existing systems;
    (5) Modifies the way in which the system operates or its location(s) 
in a manner that alters the process by which individuals can exercise 
their rights under this part, such as the ways in which they seek access 
or request amendment of a record; or
    (6) Changes the equipment configuration on which the system is 
operated so as to create the potential for greater access, such as 
adding a telecommunications capability.
    (c) The Food and Drug Administration shall issue a notice of its 
intention to establish new Privacy Act Record Systems in accordance with 
paragraph (d) of this section and Sec.  21.20(b).
    (d) Notices under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be 
published in the Federal Register for comment at least 30 days prior to 
implementation of the proposed changes or establishment of new systems. 
Interested persons shall have the opportunity to submit written data, 
views, or arguments on such proposed new uses or systems.



        Subpart C_Requirements for Specific Categories of Records



Sec.  21.30  Records of contractors.

    (a) Systems of records that are required to be operated, or as a 
matter of practical necessity must be operated, by contractors to 
accomplish Food and Drug Administration functions, from which 
information is retrieved by individual names or other personal 
identifiers, may be subject to the provisions of this part. If the 
contract is agreed to on or after September 27, 1975, the criminal 
penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) are applicable to such 
contractor, and any employee of such contractor, for disclosures 
prohibited in Sec.  21.71 or for maintenance of a system of records 
without notice as required in Sec.  21.20.
    (b) A contract is considered to accomplish a Food and Drug 
Administration function if the proposal or activity it supports is 
principally operated on behalf of and is under the direct management of 
the Food and Drug Administration. Systems of records from which 
information is retrieved by individual names or other personal 
identifiers and that are operated under contracts to accomplish Food and 
Drug Administration functions are deemed to be maintained by the agency 
and shall be subject to the procedures and requirements of this part.
    (c) A contract is not considered to accomplish a Food and Drug 
Administration function if the program or activity it supports is not 
principally operated on behalf of, or is not under the direct management 
of, the Food and Drug Administration. For example, this part does not 
apply to systems of records:
    (1) Operated under contract with the Food and Drug Administration by 
State or local government agencies, or organizations representing such 
agencies, when such agencies or organizations are also performing State 
or local government functions.

[[Page 285]]

    (2) Operated by contractors with the Food and Drug Administration by 
individuals or organizations whose primary function is delivery of 
health services, such as hospitals, physicians, pharmacists, and other 
health professionals, and that report information concerning products, 
e.g., injuries or product defects, to the Food and Drug Administration. 
Before such contractors submit information to the Food and Drug 
Administration, the names and other personal identifiers of patients or 
research subjects in any medical or similar report, test, study, or 
other research project shall be deleted, unless the contract provides 
otherwise. If the Food and Drug Administration subsequently needs the 
names of such individuals, a separate request will be made.
    (3) Relating to individuals whom the contractor employs, or with 
whom the contractor otherwise deals, in the course of providing goods 
and services to the Food and Drug Administration.
    (4) Operated under grants.
    (d) The requirements of this part shall apply when a contractor who 
operates a system of records not subject to this part reports to the 
Food and Drug Administration information that is a system of records 
about individuals from which personal information is retrieved by names 
or other personal identifiers. Where the information would be a new 
Privacy Act Record System, or a change in an existing Privacy Act Record 
System of a type described in Sec.  21.21, the Food and Drug 
Administration shall comply with the requirements of Sec.  21.21.
    (e) The Food and Drug Administration will review all contracts 
before award to determine whether operation of a system from which 
information is retrieved by individual names or other personal 
identifiers will be required of the contractor, by the terms of the 
contract or as a matter of practical necessity. If such operation will 
be required, the solicitation and contract shall include the following 
clause, or a clause of similar effect:

    Whenever the contractor or any of his employees is required by this 
contract to operate a system of records from which information is 
retrieved by individual names or other personal identifiers in order to 
accomplish a Food and Drug Administration function, the contractor and 
every employee is considered to be an employee of the Food and Drug 
Administration and shall operate such system of records in accordance 
with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), regulations of the Food 
and Drug Administration in 21 CFR part 21, and rules of conduct that 
apply to Food and Drug Administration employees who work with such 
systems of records. The contractor and his employees are subject to the 
criminal penalties set forth in 5 U.S.C. 552a(i) for violations of the 
Privacy Act.



Sec.  21.31  Records stored by the National Archives and Records
Administration.

    (a) Food and Drug Administration records that are stored, processed, 
and serviced by the National Archives and Records Administration in 
accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3103 shall be considered to be maintained by 
the Food and Drug Administration. The National Archives and Records 
Administration shall not disclose the record except to authorized Food 
and Drug Administration employees.
    (b) Each Food and Drug Administration record pertaining to an 
identifiable individual that was transferred to the National Archives of 
the United States as a record determined by the National Archives to 
have sufficient historical or other value to warrant its continued 
preservation shall be considered to be maintained by the National 
Archives and shall not be subject to the provisions of this part.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 50 FR 52278, Dec. 23, 1985]



Sec.  21.32  Personnel records.

    (a) Present and former Food and Drug Administration employees 
desiring access to personnel records about themselves should consult 
system notices applicable to the agency's personnel records that are 
published by the Office of Personnel Management and the Department as 
well as any notice issued by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (b)(1) The procedures of the Office of Personnel Management at 5 CFR 
parts 293, 294, and 297 rather than the procedures in Sec.  21.33 and 
subparts D through F of this part, govern systems of personnel records 
about Food and Drug

[[Page 286]]

Administration employees that are subject to notice published by the 
Office of Personnel Management, i.e., systems that:
    (i) The Office of Personnel Management maintains.
    (ii) Are maintained by the Division of Human Resources Management, 
Food and Drug Administration.
    (iii) Are maintained by Department Regional Offices, concerning 
field employees.
    (2) The Office of Personnel Management's procedures may, if 
necessary, be supplemented in the Food and Drug Administration Staff 
Manual Guide. Current Food and Drug Administration employees should mail 
or deliver written requests under the Privacy Act for access to 
personnel records described in this paragraph to the Office of Personnel 
Management in accordance with 5 CFR 297.106, the Director, Division of 
Human Resources Management HR-BETHPL RM7114, HFA-705, 7700 Wisconsin 
Ave., 7th & 8th floors, Bethesda, MD 20814, or the personnel officer in 
the servicing HHS Regional Personnel Office. An employee may consult 
with or direct his or her request to the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator 
(the Privacy Act Coordinator is part of the Freedom of Information 
Staff, the address for which is located on the Agency Web site at http:/
/www.fda.gov). Requests for access to personnel records of former 
employees that are located in Federal Records Centers should be directed 
to the Office of Personnel Management. Requests under the Privacy Act 
for amendment of personnel records should be directed to these same 
officials who are responsible for access to personnel records under this 
paragraph.
    (3) With respect to records subject to paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section:
    (i) Refusal to grant access to a record, or refusal to amend a 
record upon request of an employee, shall only be made by the Associate 
Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her designate; and
    (ii) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section 
may be made to the Office of Personnel Management in accordance with 5 
CFR 297.108(g)(3) and 297.113(b).
    (c) Any other Privacy Act Record Systems that contain personnel 
records, or records that otherwise concern agency employees, that are 
maintained by offices of the Food and Drug Administration rather than 
the Division of Human Resources Management but which are not subject to 
the Department's notice for personnel records in operating offices are 
subject to this part, except that refusals under this part to grant 
access to or amend records about present or former employees shall be 
made by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations rather 
than the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs.
    (d) The following procedures shall govern requests under the Privacy 
Act for personnel records that are maintained by the operating offices 
of the Food and Drug Administration in which employees work:
    (1) An employee shall upon request be told whether records about him 
are maintained. An employee shall be given access to records about 
himself that are subject to this paragraph in response to an oral or 
written request and through informal procedures, rather than the 
procedures specified in Sec. Sec.  21.40 through 21.43.
    (2) Employee identity may be verified, if necessary, by an FDA ID 
card rather than in accordance with Sec.  21.44.
    (3) Generally no fee shall be charged for records requested under 
this paragraph. However, in cases where the records requested are 
voluminous, a fee may be charged in accordance with Sec.  21.45.
    (4) Records that are subject to this paragraph shall be available 
for access to an individual, except to the extent that access is refused 
by the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or 
her designate on the grounds that the record is subject to an exemption 
under Sec.  21.61 or 5 CFR 297.111.
    (5) Requests under the Privacy Act for amendment of records subject 
to this paragraph should be directed to the Director, Division of Human 
Resources Management (HFA-400). Such requests shall be reviewed in 
accordance with subpart E of this part. Refusal to amend a record 
subject to this paragraph (d)(5) shall only be made by

[[Page 287]]

the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her 
designate.
    (6) Appeals of refusals under paragraph (d) (4) or (5) of this 
section may be made to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, except where 
the Associate Commissioner for Management and Operations or his or her 
designate indicates with his or her refusal that the appeal should be 
made to the Office of Personnel Management.
    (7) Disclosures of records subject to this paragraph are subject to 
subpart G of this part.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8457, Jan. 27, 1981; 50 
FR 52278, Dec. 23, 1985; 76 FR 31470, June 1, 2011; 79 FR 68115, Nov. 
14, 2014]



Sec.  21.33  Medical records.

    (a) In general, an individual is entitled to have access to any 
medical records about himself in Privacy Act Record Systems maintained 
by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (b) The Food and Drug Administration may apply the following special 
procedures in disclosing medical records to an individual:
    (1) The agency may review the records to determine whether 
disclosure of the record to the individual who is the subject of the 
records might have an adverse effect on him. If it is determined that 
disclosure is not likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, 
the record shall be disclosed to him. If it is determined that 
disclosure is very likely to have an adverse effect on the individual, 
he may be requested to designate, in writing, a representative to whom 
the record shall be disclosed. Such representative may be a physician, 
other health professional, or other responsible person who would be 
willing to review the record and discuss it with the individual.
    (2) The availability of the record may be subject to any procedures 
for disclosure to an individual of medical records about himself under 
part 20 of this chapter, in addition to or in lieu of the procedures in 
paragraph (b)(1), that are not inconsistent with Sec.  21.41(f).



   Subpart D_Procedures for Notification of and Access to Records in 
                       Privacy Act Record Systems



Sec.  21.40  Procedures for submitting requests for notification and access.

    (a) An individual may request that the Food and Drug Administration 
notify him whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records about 
him that are retrieved by reference to his name or other personal 
identifier. An individual may at the same time, or after receiving 
notification that such a record about him exists, requests that he be 
given access to the record.
    (b) An individual desiring notification or access to records shall 
mail or deliver a request for records in any Food and Drug 
Administration Privacy Act Records System to the FDA Privacy Act 
Coordinator (address is located on the agency web site at http://
www.gov.fda).
    (c) Requests shall be in writing and shall name the Privacy Act 
Record System or Systems concerning which the individual requests 
notification of whether there are records about him that are retrieved 
by reference to his name or other personal identifier. To help assure a 
prompt response, an individual should indicate that he is making a 
``Privacy Act Request'' on the envelope and in a prominent manner in the 
letter.
    (d) An individual who merely wishes to be notified whether a Privacy 
Act Record System contains a record about him ordinarily need not 
provide any verification of his identity other than his name. The mere 
fact that the Food and Drug Administration has a record about an 
individual in any of its Privacy Act Records Systems would not be likely 
to constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Where 
mere disclosure of the fact that a record about the individual exists 
would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, further 
verification of the identity of the individual shall be required.
    (e) An individual who requests that he be given access to a copy of 
records about himself, if any exist, should indicate whether he prefers 
(1) to have copies of any such records mailed to him

[[Page 288]]

in accordance with Sec.  21.43(a)(1), which may involve a fee under 
Sec.  21.45, including information to verify his identity under Sec.  
21.44 or (2) to use the procedures for access in person under Sec.  
21.43(a)(2).
    (f) A request for notification and access may be submitted under 
this subpart concerning any Privacy Act Record System that is exempt 
under Sec.  21.61, as indicated in the notice for the system. An 
individual seeking access to records under Sec.  21.65(b)(2) to 
investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes other than 
criminal law enforcement purposes should submit a description of the 
right, benefit, or privilege that he believes he was denied as the 
result of the Food and Drug Administration's maintenance of the records. 
Where the system is exempt under Sec.  21.61, and access to the 
requested records is not granted under Sec.  21.65, the request shall be 
handled under the provisions of part 20 of this chapter (the public 
information regulations).

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8458, Jan. 27, 1981; 50 
FR 52278, Dec. 23, 1985; 76 FR 31470, June 1, 2011; 79 FR 68115, Nov. 
14, 2014]



Sec.  21.41  Processing of requests.

    (a) An individual or his guardian under Sec.  21.75 shall not be 
required to show any justification or need to obtain notification under 
Sec.  21.42 or access to a record under Sec.  21.43.
    (b) The Food and Drug Administration will determine whether a 
request by an individual for records about himself is appropriately 
treated as a request under this subpart, or under the provision of part 
20 of this chapter (the public information regulations), or both. Where 
appropriate, the Food and Drug Administration will consult with the 
individual concerning the appropriate treatment of the request.
    (c) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in the Division of Freedom of 
Information (address is located on the agency web site at http://
www.gov.fda) shall be responsible for the handling of Privacy Act 
requests received by the Food and Drug Administration. Requests mailed 
or delivered to any other office shall be promptly redirected to the FDA 
Privacy Act Coordinator. Where this procedure would unduly delay the 
agency's response, however, the agency employee who received the request 
should consult with the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and obtain advice as 
to whether the employee can respond to the request directly.
    (d) Upon receipt of a request by the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator, a 
record shall promptly be made that a request has been received and the 
date.
    (e) A letter in accordance with Sec.  21.42 responding to the 
request for notification shall issue as promptly as possible after 
receipt of the request by the Food and Drug Administration. Upon 
determination by the Division of Freedom of Information (address is 
located on the agency web site at http://www.gov.fda) that a request for 
access to records is appropriately treated as a request under part 20 of 
this chapter rather than part 21, or under both parts, the time 
limitations prescribed in Sec.  21.41 shall apply. In any case, access 
to available records shall be provided as promptly as possible.
    (f) Except as provided in Sec.  21.32, an individual's access to 
records about him/herself that are retrieved by his/her name or other 
personal identifiers and contained in any Privacy Act Record System may 
only be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his 
or her designate. An individual shall not be denied access to any record 
that is otherwise available to him/her under this part except on the 
grounds that it is exempt under Sec.  21.65(a)(2), that it was compiled 
in reasonable anticipation of court litigation of formal administrative 
proceedings, or to the extent that it is exempt or prohibited from 
disclosure because it includes a trade secret or commercial or financial 
information that is privileged or confidential information the 
disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of 
personal privacy of another individual.
    (g) The FDA Privacy Act Coordinator shall ensure that records are 
maintained of the number, status, and disposition of requests under this 
subpart, including the number of requests for records exempt from access 
under this subpart and other information required for purposes of the 
annual report to Congress under the Privacy Act. These temporary 
administrative management

[[Page 289]]

records shall not be considered to be Privacy Act Record Systems. All 
records required to be kept under this paragraph shall only include 
requesting individuals' names or personal identifiers for so long as any 
request for notification, access, or amendment is pending. The identity 
of individuals making request under this subpart shall be regarded as 
confidential and shall not be disclosed under part 20 of this chapter 
(the public information regulations) to any other person or agency 
except as is necessary for the processing of requests under this 
subpart.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8458, Jan. 27, 1981; 76 
FR 31470, June 1, 2011; 79 FR 68115, Nov. 14, 2014]



Sec.  21.42  Responses to requests.

    (a) The FDA shall respond to an individual's request for 
notification as to whether a Privacy Act Record System contains records 
about him that are retrieved by his name or other personal identifier by 
sending a letter under this paragraph.
    (1) If there are no records about the individual that are retrieved 
by his name or other personal identifier in the named Privacy Act Record 
System, or the requester is not an ``individual'' under Sec.  21.3(a), 
the letter shall so state. Where appropriate, the letter shall indicate 
that the Food and Drug Administration's public information regulations 
in part 20 of this chapter prescribe general rules governing the 
availability of information to members of the public, and that a request 
may be made in accordance with part 20 of this chapter for records that 
are not retrieved by the requester's name or other personal identifier 
from a Privacy Act Record System.
    (2) If there are records about the individual that are retrieved by 
his name or other personal identifier and the named Privacy Act Record 
System is not exempt from individual access and contest under Sec.  
21.61, or the system is exempt but access is allowed or required under 
Sec.  21.65, the letter shall inform him that the records exist and 
shall either:
    (i) Enclose a copy of the records under Sec.  21.43(a)(1) or 
indicate that the records will be sent under separate cover, where there 
has been adequate verification of the identity of the individual under 
Sec.  21.44 and the fees under Sec.  21.45 do not exceed $25, or
    (ii) Inform the individual of the procedures to obtain access to the 
records by mail or in person under Sec.  21.43(a)(2), as well as the 
approximate dates by which the requested records can be provided (if the 
records are not then available), the locations at which access in person 
may be had, and the information needed, if any, to verify the identity 
of the individual under Sec.  21.44.
    (3) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about 
the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal 
identifier, and the system is exempt from individual access and contest 
under Sec.  21.61 and access is not allowed or required under Sec.  
21.65, the letter should inform him that the records are exempted from 
access and contest by Sec.  21.61. The letter shall also inform him if 
the records sought are not available because they were compiled in 
reasonable anticipation of court litigation or formal administrative 
proceedings or are otherwise not available under Sec.  21.41(b). Where 
appropriate, the letter shall also indicate whether the records are 
available under part 20 of this chapter (the public information 
regulations), and it may disclose the records in accordance with part 
20.
    (4) If the named Privacy Act Record System contains records about 
the individual that are retrieved by his name or other personal 
identifier, but a final determination has not yet been made with respect 
to disclosure of all of the records covered by the request, e.g., 
because it is necessary to consult another person or agency having an 
interest in the confidentiality of the records, the letter shall explain 
the circumstances and indicate when a final answer will be given.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec.  21.32, access to a record may only 
be denied by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her 
designate. If access to any record is denied wholly or in substantial 
part, the letter shall state the right of the individual to appeal to 
the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (c) If a request for a copy of the records will result in a fee of 
more than

[[Page 290]]

$25, the letter shall specify or estimate the fee involved. Where the 
individual has requested a copy of any records about him and copying the 
records would result in a fee of over $50, the Food and Drug 
Administration shall require advance deposit as well as payment of any 
amount not yet received as a result of any previous request by the 
individual for a record about himself, under this subpart or part 20 of 
this chapter (the public information regulations) before the records are 
made available. If the fee is less than $50, prepayment shall not be 
required unless payment has not yet been received for records disclosed 
as a result of a previous request by the individual for a record about 
himself under this subpart or part 20 of this chapter.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8458, Jan. 27, 1981]



Sec.  21.43  Access to requested records.

    (a) Access may be granted to requested records by:
    (1) Mailing a copy of the records to the requesting individual, or
    (2) Permitting the requesting individual to review the records in 
person between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. at the office of the FDA Privacy Act 
Coordinator, at the Division of Freedom of Information Public Reading 
Room (address is located on the agency's web site at http://
www.fda.gov), or at any Food and Drug Administration field office, 
listed in part 5, subpart M of this chapter, or at another location or 
time upon which the Food and Drug Administration and the individual 
agree. Arrangement for such review can be made by consultation between 
the FDA Privacy Act Coordinator and the individual. An individual 
seeking to review records in person shall generally be permitted access 
to the file copy, except that where the records include nondisclosable 
information, a copy shall be made of that portion of the records, with 
the nondisclosable information blocked out. Where the individual is not 
given a copy of the record to retain, no charge shall be made for the 
cost of copying a record to make it available to an individual who 
reviews a record in person under this paragraph.
    (b) An individual may request that a record be disclosed to or 
discussed in the presence of another individual, such as an attorney. 
The individual may be required to furnish a written statement 
authorizing the disclosure or discussion in such other individual's 
presence.
    (c) The Food and Drug Administration will make every reasonable 
effort to assure that records made available under this section can be 
understood by the individual, such as by providing an oral or written 
explanation of the records.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8458, Jan. 27, 1981; 69 
FR 17290, Apr. 2, 2004; 76 FR 31470, June 1, 2011; 79 FR 68115, Nov. 14, 
2014]



Sec.  21.44  Verification of identity.

    (a) An individual seeking access to records in a Privacy Act Record 
System may be required to comply with reasonable requirements to enable 
the Food and Drug Administration to determine his identity. The 
identification required shall be suitable considering the nature of the 
records sought. No identification shall be required to receive access to 
information that is required to be disclosed to any member of the public 
under part 20 of this chapter (the public information regulations).
    (b) An individual who appears in person for access to records about 
himself shall be required to provide at least one document to identify 
himself, e.g., driver's license, passport, or alien or voter 
registration card to verify his identity. If an individual does not have 
any such document or requests access to records about himself without 
appearing in person under circumstances in which his identity cannot be 
verified from the request itself, he shall be required to certify in 
writing that he is the individual he claims to be and that he 
understands that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a 
record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal 
offense subject to a $5,000 fine.
    (c) In making requests under Sec.  21.75, a parent of a minor child 
or legal guardian of an incompetent individual may be required to verify 
his relationship to the minor child or the incompetent individual, in 
addition to verifying his own identity, by providing a copy of

[[Page 291]]

the minor's birth certificate, a court order, or other evidence of 
guardianship.
    (d) Where an individual seeks access to particularly sensitive 
records, such as medical records, the individual may be required to 
provide additional information beyond that specified in paragraph (b) or 
(c) of this section, such as the individual's years of attendance at a 
particular educational institution, rank attained in the uniformed 
services, date or place of birth, names of parents, an occupation, or 
the specific times the individual received medical treatment.



Sec.  21.45  Fees.

    (a) Where applicable, fees for copying records shall be charged in 
accordance with the schedule set forth in this section. Fees may only be 
charged where an individual has requested that a copy be made of a 
record to which he is granted access. No fee may be charged for making a 
search of a Privacy Act Record System whether the search is manual, 
mechanical, or electronic. Where a copy of the record must be made to 
provide access to the record, e.g., computer printout where no screen

       Subpart E_Procedures for Requests for Amendment of Records



Sec.  21.50  Procedures for submitting requests for amendment of records.

    (a) An individual who received access to a record about himself 
under subpart D of this part may request that the record be amended if 
he believes that the record or an item of information is not accurate, 
relevant to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete.
    (b) Amendments under this subpart shall not violate existing 
statute, regulation, or administrative procedure.
    (1) This subpart does not permit alteration of evidence presented in 
the course of judicial proceedings or Food and Drug Administration 
adjudicatory or rule making proceedings or collateral attack upon that 
which has already been the subject of any such proceedings.
    (2) If the accuracy, relevancy, timeliness, or completeness of the 
records may be contested in any other pending or imminent agency 
proceeding, the Food and Drug Administration may refer the individual to 
the other proceeding as the appropriate means to obtain relief. If the 
accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of a record is, or has 
been, an issue in another agency proceeding, the request under this 
section shall be disposed of in accordance with the decision in the 
other proceeding, absent unusual circumstances.
    (c) Requests to amend records shall be submitted, in writing, to the 
FDA Privacy Act Coordinator in accordance with Sec.  21.40(b). Such 
requests shall include information sufficient to enable the Food and 
Drug Administration to locate the record, a brief description of the 
items of information requested to be amended, and the reasons why the 
record should be amended together with any appropriate documentation or 
arguments in support of the requested amendment. An edited copy of the

[[Page 292]]

record showing the described amendment may be included. Verification of 
identity should be provided in accordance with Sec.  21.44.
    (d) Written acknowledgement of the receipt of a request to amend a 
record shall be provided within 10 working days to the individual who 
requested the amendment. Such acknowledgement may request any additional 
information needed to verify identity or make a determination. No 
acknowledgement need be made if the request can be reviewed, processed, 
and the individual notified of the agency's agreement with the request 
or refusal within the 10-day period.

[42 FR 15626, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 46 FR 8459, Jan. 27, 1981]



Sec.  21.51  Responses to requests for amendment of records.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration shall take one of the following 
actions on a request for amendment of records as promptly as possible:
    (1) Amend any portion of the record which the agency has determined, 
based upon a preponderance of the evidence, is not accurate, relevant to 
a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timely, or complete, and, in 
accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, inform the individual 
and previous recipients of the record that has been amended of the 
amendment.
    (2) Inform the individual of its refusal to amend any portion of the 
record in the manner requested, the reason for the refusal, and the 
opportunity for administrative appeal to the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs. Except as provided in Sec.  21.32, such refusal may only be 
issued by the Associate Commissioner for Public Affairs or his or her 
designate.
    (3) Where another agency was the source of and has control of the 
record, refer the request to that agency.
    (b) The agency may, for good cause, extend the period for taking 
action an additional 30 working days if notice is provided to the 
individual explaining the circumstances of the delay.
    (c) The officials charged with reviewing a record to determine how 
to respond to a request to amend it, shall assess its accuracy, 
relevance to a Food and Drug Administration purpose, timeliness, or 
completeness. The determination shall be made in the light of the 
purpose for which the records or system is used, the agency's need for 
the record, and the possible adverse consequences to the individual from 
the record if not amended. Whenever the Food and Drug Administration 
receives a request for deletion of a record, or portions of a record, it 
shall consider anew whether the contested information in the record is 
relevant and necessary to a Food and Drug Administration purpose.
    (d) If the Food and Drug Administration agrees with an individual's 
request, it shall take the following actions:
    (1) So inform the individual in writing.
    (2) In accordance with statute, regulation, or procedure, amend the 
record to make it accurate, relevant to a Food and Drug Administration 
purpose, timely, or complete, making note of the date and fact of the 
amendment.
    (3) If an accounting was made under Sec.  21.71(d) of a disclosure 
of the record under Sec.  21.71(a), provide a copy of the record as 
amended, to all previous recipients of the record.

Commissioner of Food and Drugs,(see the address on the agency's web site 
at http://www.fda.gov).

the record as requested, he shall inform the individual:
    (1) Of his decision and the reasons for it.
    (2) Of the individual's right to file with the Food and Drug 
Administration a concise statement of the individual's reasons for 
disagreeing with the agency's decision not to amend the record as 
requested.

persons listed in an accounting as having previously received the record 
and any

[[Page 293]]

person to whom the record is subsequently disclosed together with, in

summarizing its reasons for refusing to amend the record. Any individual 
who includes false information in the statement of disagreement filed 
with the Food and Drug Administration may be subject to penalties under 
18 U.S.C. 1001, the False Reports to the Government Act.
    (4) That the individual has a right to seek judicial review of the 
refusal to amend the record.
    (c) If the Commissioner on administrative appeal or a court on 
judicial review determines that the record should be amended in 
accordance with the individual's request, the Food and Drug 
Administration shall proceed in accordance with Sec.  21.51(d).
    (d) A final determination on the individual's administrative appeal 
of the initial refusal to amend the record shall be concluded within 30

informs the individual in writing of the reasons for the delay and of 
the approximate date on which a decision of the appeal can be expected.

21.52(b)(2), the Food and Drug Administration shall:
    (a) Mark any portion of the record that is disputed to assure that 
the record will clearly show that portion is disputed whenever the 
record is disclosed.
    (b) In any subsequent disclosure under Sec.  21.70 or Sec.  
21.71(a), provide a copy of the statement of disagreement and, if the 
Food and Drug Administration deems it appropriate, a concise statement 
of the agency's reasons for not making the amendment(s) requested. While 
the individual shall have access to any such statement, it shall not be 
subject to a request for amendment under Sec.  21.50.
    (c) If an accounting was made under Sec.  21.71(d) and (e) of a 
disclosure of the record under Sec.  21.71(a), provide to all previous 
recipients of the record a copy of the statement of disagreement and the 
agency statement, if any.



Sec.  21.54  Amended or disputed records received from other agencies.

    Whenever the Food and Drug Administration is notified that a record 
that it received from another agency was amended or is the subject of a 
statement of disagreement, the Food and Drug Administration shall:
    (a) Discard the record, or clearly note the amendment or the fact of 
disagreement in its copy of the record, and
    (b) Refer persons who subsequently request the record to the agency 
that provided it.
    (c) If an accounting was made under Sec.  21.71 (d) and (e) of the 
disclosure of the record under Sec.  21.71(a), inform all previous 
recipients of the record about the amendment or provide to them the 
statement of disagreement and the agency statement, if any.



                          Subpart F_Exemptions



Sec.  21.60  Policy.

    It is the policy of the Food and Drug Administration that record

essential to the performance of law enforcement functions under the laws 
that are administered and enforced by the Food and Drug Administration 
or that govern the agency.



Sec.  21.61  Exempt systems.

    (a) Investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes, 
including criminal law enforcement purposes, in the Food and Drug 
Administration Privacy Act Record Systems listed in paragraph (b) of 
this section are exempt from the following provisions of the Privacy Act 
(5 U.S.C. 552a) and of this part:
    (1) Such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and Sec.  
21.71(e)(4), requiring that an individual be provided with the 
accounting of disclosures of records

[[Page 294]]

about himself from a Privacy Act Record System.
    (2) Except where access is required under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and 
Sec.  21.65(a)(2), (such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(d)(1) 
through (4) and (f)) and Sec. Sec.  21.40 through 21.54, requiring 
procedures for an individual to be given notification of and access to 
records about himself in a Privacy Act Record System and to be allowed 
to challenge the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, and completeness of 
such records.
    (3) Such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(4)(G) and (H) and 
Sec.  21.20(b)(1) requiring inclusion in the notice for the system of 
information about agency procedures for notification, access, and 
contest.
    (4) Such records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(e)(3) requiring that 
individuals asked to supply information be provided a form outlining the 
authority for the request, the purposes for which the information will 
be used, the routine uses in the notice for the Privacy Act Record 
System, and the consequences to the individual of not providing the 
information, but only with respect to records compiled by the Food and 
Drug Administration in a criminal law enforcement investigation where 
the conduct of the investigation would be prejudiced by such procedures.
    (b) Records in the following Food and Drug Administration Privacy 
Act Record Systems that concern individuals who are subject to Food and 
Drug Administration enforcement action and consist of investigatory 
records compiled for law enforcement purposes, including criminal law 
enforcement purposes, are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) and (k)(2) 
from the provisions enumerated in paragraph (a) of this section:
    (1) Bio-research Monitoring Information System--HHS/FDA/09-10-0010.

civilian employment, military service, Federal contracts, and access to 
classified information. These records are exempt from disclosure under 5 
U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) to the extent that the disclosure would reveal the 
identity of a source who furnished information to the Government under a 
promise of confidentiality, which must be an express promise if the 
information was furnished after September 27, 1975. Any individual who 
is refused access to a record that would reveal a confidential source 
shall be advised in a general way that the record includes information 
that would reveal a confidential source.
    (d) Records in the following Food and Drug Administration Privacy 
Act Records Systems are exempt under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5) from 
the provisions enumerated in paragraph (a)(1) through paragraph (a)(3)

FR 52278, Dec. 23, 1985; 78 FR 39186, July 1, 2013]



Sec.  21.65  Access to records in exempt systems.

    (a) Where a Privacy Act Record System is exempt and the requested 
records are unavailable under Sec.  21.61, an individual may 
nevertheless make a request under Sec.  21.40 for notification 
concerning whether any records about him exist and request access to 
such records where they are retrieved by his name or other personal 
identifier.
    (b) An individual making a request under paragraph (a) of this 
section;
    (1) May be given access to the records where available under part 20 
of this chapter (the public information regulations) or the Commissioner 
may, in his discretion, entertain a request under any or all of the 
provisions of Sec. Sec.  21.40 through 21.54; and
    (2) Shall be given access upon request if the records requested are 
subject to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and not to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) (i.e., 
because they consist of investigatory material compiled for law 
enforcement purposes other than criminal law enforcement purposes) and 
maintenance of the records resulted in denial to the individual of

[[Page 295]]

any right, benefit, or privilege to which he would otherwise be entitled 
by Federal law, or for which he would otherwise be eligible. An 
individual given access to a record under this paragraph (b)(2) is not 
entitled to seek amendment under subpart E of this part. The FDA may 
refuse to disclose a record that would reveal the identity of a source 
who furnished information to the Government under a promise of 
confidentiality, which must be an express promise if the information was 
furnished on or after September 27, 1975. Any individual refused access 
to a record that would reveal a confidential source shall be advised in 
a general way that the record contains information that would reveal a 
confidential source.
    (c) The Commissioner shall not make available any record that is 
prohibited from public disclosure under Sec.  20.82(b) of this chapter.
    (d) Discretionary disclosure of a record pursuant to paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section shall not set a precedent for discretionary 
disclosure of a similar or related record and shall not obligate the 
Commissioner to exercise his discretion to disclose any other record in 
a system that is exempt under Sec.  21.61.

Sec.  25.1  Purpose.

    The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, 
directs that, to the fullest extent possible, the policies, regulations, 
and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and 
administered in accordance with the policies set forth in NEPA. All 
agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with the procedures in 
section 102(2) of NEPA except where compliance would be inconsistent 
with other statutory requirements. The regulations in this part 
implement section 102(2) of NEPA in a manner that is consistent with 
FDA's authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the

Sec.  25.10  Policies and NEPA planning.

    (a) All FDA's policies and programs will be planned, developed, and 
implemented to achieve the policies declared by NEPA and required by 
CEQ's regulations to ensure responsible stewardship of the environment 
for present and future generations.
    (b) Assessment of environmental factors continues throughout 
planning and is integrated with other program planning at the earliest 
possible time to ensure that planning and decisions reflect 
environmental values, to avoid delays later in the process, and to avoid 
potential conflicts.
    (c) For actions initiated by the agency, the NEPA process will begin 
when the agency action under consideration is first identified. For 
actions initiated by applicants or petitioners, NEPA planning begins 
when FDA receives from an applicant or petitioner an EA or a claim that 
a categorical exclusion applies, or when FDA personnel consult with 
applicants or petitioners on the NEPA-related aspects of their requested 
actions. FDA may issue a public call for environmental data or otherwise 
consult with affected individuals or groups when a contemplated action 
in which it is or may be involved poses potential significant 
environmental effects.
    (d) Environmental documents shall concentrate on timely and 
significant issues, not amass needless detail.
    (e) If a proposed action for which an EIS will be prepared involves 
possible environmental effects that are required to be considered under 
statutes or Executive Orders other than those referred to under 
``Authority'' in this part, these effects shall be considered in the 
NEPA review, consistent with 40 CFR 1502.25 and the HHS General 
Administration Manual, part 30: Environmental Protection.

[[Page 300]]



     Subpart B_Agency Actions Requiring Environmental Consideration



Sec.  25.15  General procedures.

    (a) All applications or petitions requesting agency action require 
the submission of an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion. A claim of 
categorical exclusion shall include a statement of compliance with the 
categorical exclusion criteria and shall state that to the applicant's 
knowledge, no extraordinary circumstances exist. Failure to submit an 
adequate EA for an application or petition requesting action by the 
agency of a type specified in Sec.  25.20, unless the agency can 
determine that the action qualifies for exclusion under Sec. Sec.  
25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35 is sufficient grounds for 
FDA to refuse to file or approve the application or petition. An EA 
adequate for filing is one that addresses the relevant environmental 
issues. An EA adequate for approval is one that contains sufficient 
information to enable the agency to determine whether the proposed 
action may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.
    (b) The responsible agency officials will evaluate the information 
contained in the EA to determine whether it is accurate and objective, 
whether the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the 
human environment, and whether an EIS will be prepared. If significant 
effects requiring the preparation of an EIS are identified, FDA will 
prepare an EIS for the action in accordance with the procedures in 
subparts D and E of this part. If significant effects requiring the 
preparation of an EIS are not identified, resulting in a decision not to 
prepare an EIS, the responsible agency official will prepare a FONSI in 
accordance with Sec.  25.41.
    (c) Classes of actions that individually or cumulatively do not 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment ordinarily are 
excluded from the requirement to prepare an EA or an EIS. The classes of 
actions that qualify as categorical exclusions are set forth in 
Sec. Sec.  25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35.
    (d) A person submitting an application or petition of a type subject 
to categorical exclusion under Sec. Sec.  25.30, 25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 
25.34, or 25.35, or proposing to dispose of an article as provided in 
Sec.  25.30(d) or 25.32(h), is not required to submit an EA if the 
person states that the action requested qualifies for a categorical 
exclusion, citing the particular categorical exclusion that is claimed, 
and states that to the applicant's knowledge, no extraordinary 
circumstances exist.

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 80 FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015]



Sec.  25.16  Public health and safety emergencies.

    There are certain regulatory actions that, because of their 
immediate importance to the public health or safety, may make full 
adherence to the procedural provisions of NEPA and CEQ's regulations 
impossible. For such actions, the responsible agency official shall 
consult with CEQ about alternative arrangements before the action is 
taken, or after the action is taken, if time does not permit prior 
consultation with CEQ.



Sec.  25.20  Actions requiring preparation of an environmental assessment.

    Any proposed action of a type specified in this section normally 
requires at least the preparation of an EA, unless it is an action in a 
specific class that qualifies for exclusion under Sec. Sec.  25.30, 
25.31, 25.32, 25.33, 25.34, or 25.35:
    (a) Major recommendations or reports made to Congress on proposals 
for legislation in instances where the agency has primary responsibility 
for the subject matter involved.
    (b) Destruction or other disposition of articles condemned after 
seizure or whose distribution or use has been enjoined, unless 
categorically excluded in Sec. Sec.  25.30(d) or 25.32(h).

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 30355, May 11, 2000; 72 
FR 69118, Dec. 6, 2007; 80 FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015]



Sec.  25.21  Extraordinary circumstances.

    As required under 40 CFR 1508.4, FDA will require at least an EA for 
any specific action that ordinarily would be excluded if extraordinary 
circumstances indicate that the specific proposed action may 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment (see 40 CFR 
1508.27 for examples of significant impacts). Examples of such 
extraordinary circumstances include:
    (a) Actions for which available data establish that, at the expected 
level of exposure, there is the potential for serious harm to the 
environment; and
    (b) Actions that adversely affect a species or the critical habitat 
of a species determined under the Endangered Species Act or the 
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora 
and Fauna to be endangered or threatened or wild flora or fauna that are 
entitled to special protection under some other Federal law.



Sec.  25.22  Actions requiring the preparation of an environmental
impact statement.

    (a) There are no categories of agency actions that routinely 
significantly affect the quality of the human environment and that 
therefore ordinarily require the preparation of an EIS.
    (b) EIS's are prepared for agency actions when evaluation of data or 
information in an EA or otherwise available

[[Page 302]]

to the agency leads to a finding by the responsible agency official that 
a proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment.

Sec.  25.34  Devices and electronic products.

    The classes of actions listed in this section are categorically 
excluded and, therefore, ordinarily do not require the preparation of an 
EA or an EIS:
    (a) Action on a device premarket notification submission under 
subpart E of part 807 of this chapter.
    (b) Classification or reclassification of a device under part 860 of

Sec.  25.35  Tobacco product applications.

    The classes of actions listed in this section are categorically 
excluded and, therefore, normally do not require the preparation of an 
EA or an EIS:
    (a) Issuance of an order finding a tobacco product substantially 
equivalent under section 910(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and 
Cosmetic Act;

            Subpart D_Preparation of Environmental Documents



Sec.  25.40  Environmental assessments.

    (a) As defined by CEQ in 40 CFR 1508.9, an EA is a concise public 
document that serves to provide sufficient evidence and analysis for an 
agency to determine whether to prepare an EIS or a FONSI. The EA shall 
include brief discussions of the need for the proposal, of alternatives 
as required by section 102(2)(E) of NEPA, of the environmental impacts 
of the proposed action and alternatives, and a listing of agencies and 
persons consulted. An EA shall be prepared for each action not 
categorically excluded in Sec.  25.30, Sec.  25.31, Sec.  25.32, Sec.  
25.33, or Sec.  25.34, or Sec.  25.35. The EA shall focus on relevant 
environmental issues relating to the use and disposal from use of FDA-
regulated articles and shall be a concise, objective, and well-balanced 
document that allows the public to understand the agency's decision. If 
potentially adverse environmental impacts are identified for an action 
or a group of related actions, the EA shall discuss any reasonable 
alternative course of action that offers less environmental risk or that 
is environmentally preferable to the proposed action. The use of a 
scientifically justified tiered testing approach, in which testing may 
be stopped when the results suggest that no significant impact will 
occur, is an acceptable approach.
    (b) Generally, FDA requires an applicant to prepare an EA and make 
necessary corrections to it. Ultimately, FDA is responsible for the 
scope and content of EA's and may include additional information in 
environmental documents when warranted.
    (c) Information concerning the nature and scope of information that 
an applicant or petitioner shall submit in an EA may be obtained from 
the center or other office of the agency having responsibility for the 
action that is the subject of the environmental evaluation. Applicants 
and petitioners are encouraged to submit proposed protocols for 
environmental studies for technical review by agency staff. Applicants 
and petitioners also are encouraged to consult applicable FDA EA 
guidance documents, which provide additional advice on how to comply 
with FDA regulations.
    (d) Consistent with 40 CFR 1500.4(j) and 1502.21, EA's may 
incorporate by reference information presented in other documents that 
are available to FDA and to the public.
    (e) The agency evaluates the information contained in an EA and any 
public input to determine whether it is accurate and objective, whether 
the proposed action may significantly affect the quality of the human 
environment, and whether an EIS or a FONSI will be prepared. The 
responsible agency official examines the environmental risks of the 
proposed action and the alternative courses of action, selects a course 
of action, and ensures that any necessary mitigating measures are 
implemented as a condition for approving the selected course of action.

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 17291, Apr. 2, 2004; 80 
FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015]



Sec.  25.41  Findings of no significant impact.

    (a) As defined by the CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.13), a FONSI is a 
document prepared by a Federal agency stating briefly why an action, not 
otherwise excluded, will not significantly affect the human environment 
and for which, therefore, an EIS will not be prepared. A FONSI includes 
the EA or a summary of it and a reference to any other related 
environmental documents.
    (b) The agency official(s) responsible for approving the FONSI will 
sign the document, thereby establishing that the official(s) approve(s) 
the conclusion not to prepare an EIS for the action under consideration.

[[Page 307]]



Sec.  25.42  Environmental impact statements.

    (a) As defined by CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1508.11) and section 
102(2)(C) of NEPA, an EIS should be a clear, concise, and detailed 
written statement describing:
    (1) The environmental impacts of a proposed action;
    (2) Any adverse effects that cannot be avoided if the action is 
implemented;
    (3) Alternatives to the action;
    (4) The relationship between local short-term uses of the 
environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term 
productivity; and
    (5) Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources that 
would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.
    (b) The CEQ regulations (40 CFR 1501.7 and part 1502) describe the 
process for determining the scope of an EIS and provide detailed 
requirements for the preparation of draft and final EIS's. CEQ format 
and procedures for preparing EIS shall be followed.
    (c) Under the conditions prescribed in 40 CFR 1502.9, the agency 
will prepare a supplement for a draft or final EIS and introduce the 
supplement into the administrative record.



Sec.  25.43  Records of decision.

    (a) In cases requiring environmental impact statements, at the time 
of its decision, the agency shall prepare a concise public record of 
decision.
    (b) The record of decision shall:
    (1) State what the decision was;
    (2) Identify and discuss alternatives considered by the agency in 
reaching its decision;
    (3) State whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize 
environmental harm have been adopted, and if not, why not; and
    (4) Summarize the program for monitoring and enforcing the 
practicable means adopted to avoid or minimize the environmental harm.



Sec.  25.44  Lead and cooperating agencies.

    For actions requiring the preparation of an EIS, FDA and other 
affected Federal agencies will agree which will be the lead agency and 
which will be the cooperating agencies. The responsibilities of lead 
agencies and cooperating agencies are described in the CEQ regulations 
(40 CFR 1501.5 and 1501.6, respectively). If an action affects more than 
one center within FDA, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will designate 
one of these units to be responsible for coordinating the preparation of 
any required environmental documentation.



Sec.  25.45  Responsible agency official.

    (a) The responsible agency official prepares the environmental 
documents or ensures that they are prepared.
    (b) The responsible agency official will weigh any environmental 
impacts of each alternative course of action, including possible 
mitigation measures, and will balance environmental impacts with the 
agency's objectives in choosing an appropriate course of action. The 
weighing of any environmental impacts of alternatives in selecting a 
final course of action will be reflected in the agency's record of 
formal decisionmaking as required by 40 CFR 1505.2.

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 69 FR 17291, Apr. 2, 2004]



    Subpart E_Public Participation and Notification of Environmental 
                                Documents



Sec.  25.50  General information.

    (a) To the extent actions are not protected from disclosure by 
existing law applicable to the agency's operation, FDA will involve the 
public in preparing and implementing its NEPA procedures and will 
provide public notice of NEPA-related hearings, public meetings, and the 
availability of environmental documents.
    (b) Many FDA actions involving investigations, review, and approval 
or market authorization of applications, and premarket notifications for 
human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, and tobacco 
products are protected from disclosure under the Trade Secret Act, 18 
U.S.C. 1905, and section 301(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act. These actions are also protected from disclosure under FDA's 
regulations including part 20, Sec. Sec.  312.130(a), 314.430(b), 
514.11(b), 514.12(a), 601.50(a), 601.51(a), 807.95(b), 812.38(a), and 
814.9(b) of this chapter.

[[Page 308]]

Even the existence of applications for human drugs, animal drugs, 
biologic products, devices, and tobacco products is protected from 
disclosure under these regulations. Therefore, unless the existence of 
applications for human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, tobacco 
products, or premarket notification for devices has been made publicly 
available, the release of the environmental document before approval or 
authorization of human drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices 
and tobacco products is inconsistent with statutory requirements imposed 
on FDA. Appropriate environmental documents, comments, and responses 
will be included in the administrative record to the extent allowed by 
applicable laws.

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 80 FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015]



Sec.  25.51  Environmental assessments and findings of no significant
impact.

    (a) Data and information that are protected from disclosure by 18 
U.S.C. 1905 or 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 360j(c) shall not be included in the 
portion of environmental documents that is made public. When such data 
and information are pertinent to the environmental review of a proposed 
action, an applicant or petitioner shall submit such data and 
information separately in a confidential section and shall summarize the 
confidential data and information in the EA to the extent possible.
    (b) FONSI's and EA's will be available to the public in accordance 
with 40 CFR 1506.6 as follows:
    (1) When the proposed action is the subject of a notice of proposed 
rulemaking or a notice of filing published in the Federal Register, the 
notice shall state that no EIS is necessary and that the FONSI and the 
EA are available for public inspection at FDA's Division of Dockets 
Management. If the responsible agency official is unable to complete 
environmental consideration of the proposed action before a notice of 
filing of a food or color additive petition is required to be published 
under the act, and if the subsequent environmental analysis leads to the 
conclusion that no EIS is necessary, the final regulation rather than 
the notice of filing shall state that no EIS is necessary and that the 
FONSI and the EA are available upon request and filed in FDA's Division 
of Dockets Management.
    (2) For actions for which notice is not published in the Federal 
Register, the FONSI and the EA shall be made available to the public 
upon request according to the procedures in 40 CFR 1506.6.
    (3) For a limited number of actions, the agency may make the FONSI 
and EA available for public review (including review by State and 
areawide information clearinghouses) for 30 days before the agency makes 
its final determination whether to prepare an EIS and before the action 
may begin, as described in 40 CFR 1501.4(e). This procedure will be 
followed when the proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one that 
normally requires an EIS or when the proposed action is one without 
precedent.



Sec.  25.52  Environmental impact statements.

    (a) If FDA determines that an EIS is necessary for an action 
involving investigations, approvals, or market authorizations for drugs, 
animal drugs, biologic products, devices, or tobacco products, an EIS 
will be prepared but will become available only at the time of the 
approval or market authorization of the product. The EIS will in all 
other respects conform to the requirements for EIS's as specified in 40 
CFR part 1502 and 1506.6(f).
    (b) Comments on the EIS may be submitted after the approval or 
market authorization of the drug, animal drug, biologic product, device, 
or tobacco product. Those comments can form the basis for the Agency to 
consider beginning an action to withdraw the approval or market 
authorization of applications for a drug, animal drug, biologic product, 
or tobacco product, or to withdraw premarket notifications or premarket 
approval applications for devices.
    (c) In those cases where the existence of applications and premarket 
notifications for drugs, animal drugs, biologic products, devices, or 
tobacco products has already been disclosed before the

[[Page 309]]

Agency approves the action, the Agency will ensure appropriate public 
involvement consistent with 40 CFR 1506.6 and part 1503 in preparing and 
implementing the NEPA procedures related to preparing EISs while 
following its own disclosure requirements including those listed in part 
20 and Sec. Sec.  312.130(b), 314.430(d), 514.11(d), 514.12(b), 
601.51(d), 807.95(e), 812.38(b), and 814.9(d) of this chapter.
    (d) Draft and final EIS's, comments, and responses will be included 
in the administrative record and will be available from the Division of 
Dockets Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers 
Lane, rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852.

[62 FR 40592, July 29, 1997, as amended at 68 FR 24879, May 9, 2003; 80 
FR 57535, Sept. 24, 2015]



                      Subpart F_Other Requirements



Sec.  25.60  Environmental effects abroad of major agency actions.

    (a) In accordance with Executive Order 12114, ``Environmental 
Effects Abroad of Major Federal Actions'' of January 4, 1979 (44 FR 
1957, January 9, 1979), the responsible agency official, in analyzing 
actions under his or her program, shall consider the environmental 
effects abroad, including whether the actions involve:
    (1) Potential environmental effects on the global commons and areas 
outside the jurisdiction of any nation, e.g., oceans and the upper 
atmosphere.
    (2) Potential environmental effects on a foreign nation not 
participating with or otherwise involved in an FDA activity.
    (3) The export of products (or emissions) that in the United States 
are prohibited or strictly regulated because their effects on the 
environment create a serious public health risk.
    (4) Potential environmental effects on natural and ecological 
resources of global importance designated under the Executive Order.
    (b) Before deciding on any action falling into the categories 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section, the responsible agency 
official shall determine, in accordance with section 2-3 of the 
Executive Order, whether such actions may have a significant 
environmental effect abroad.
    (c) If the responsible agency official determines that an action may 
have a significant environmental effect abroad, the responsible agency 
official shall determine, in accordance with section 2-4 (a) and (b) of 
the Executive Order, whether the subject action calls for:
    (1) An EIS;
    (2) A bilateral or multilateral environmental study; or
    (3) A concise environmental review.
    (d) In preparing environmental documents under this subpart, the 
responsible official shall:
    (1) Determine, as provided in section 2-5 of the Executive Order, 
whether proposed actions are subject to the exemptions, exclusions, and 
modification in contents, timing, and availability of documents.
    (2) Coordinate all communications with foreign governments 
concerning environmental agreements and other arrangements in 
implementing the Executive Order.

Sec.  26.0  General.

    This part substantially reflects relevant provisions of the 
framework agreement and its sectoral annexes on pharmaceutical good 
manufacturing practices (GMP's) and medical devices of the ``Agreement 
on Mutual Recognition Between the United States of America and the 
European Community'' (the MRA), signed at London May 18, 1998. For 
codification purposes, certain provisions of the MRA have been modified 
for use in this part. This modification is done for purposes of clarity 
only and shall not affect the text of the MRA concluded between the 
United States and the European Community (EC), or the rights and 
obligations of the United States or the EC under that agreement. Whereas 
the parties to the MRA are the United States and EC, this part is 
relevant only to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) 
implementation of the MRA, including the sectoral annexes reflected in 
subparts A and B of this

[[Page 311]]

part. This part does not govern implementation of the MRA by the EC, 
which will implement the MRA in accordance with its internal procedures, 
nor does this part address implementation of the MRA by other concerned 
U.S. Federal agencies. For purposes of this part, the terms ``party'' or 
``parties,'' where relevant to FDA's implementation of the MRA, should 
be considered as referring to FDA only. If the parties to the MRA 
subsequently amend or terminate the MRA, FDA will modify this part 
accordingly, using appropriate administrative procedures.



      Subpart A_Specific Sector Provisions for Pharmaceutical Good 
                         Manufacturing Practices



Sec.  26.1  Definitions.

    (a) Enforcement means action taken by an authority to protect the 
public from products of suspect quality, safety, and effectiveness or to 
assure that products are manufactured in compliance with appropriate 
laws, regulations, standards, and commitments made as part of the 
approval to market a product.
    (b) Equivalence of the regulatory systems means that the systems are 
sufficiently comparable to assure that the process of inspection and the 
ensuing inspection reports will provide adequate information to 
determine whether respective statutory and regulatory requirements of 
the authorities have been fulfilled. Equivalence does not require that 
the respective regulatory systems have identical procedures.
    (c) Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP's). [The United States has 
clarified its interpretation that under the MRA, paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section has to be understood as the U.S. definition and paragraph 
(c)(2) as the EC definition.]
    (1) GMP's mean the requirements found in the legislations, 
regulations, and administrative provisions for methods to be used in, 
and the facilities or controls to be used for, the manufacturing, 
processing, packing, and/or holding of a drug to assure that such drug 
meets the requirements as to safety, and has the identity and strength, 
and meets the quality and purity characteristics that it purports or is 
represented to possess.
    (2) GMP's are that part of quality assurance which ensures that 
products are consistently produced and controlled to quality standards. 
For the purpose of this subpart, GMP's include, therefore, the system 
whereby the manufacturer receives the specifications of the product and/
or process from the marketing authorization/product authorization or 
license holder or applicant and ensures the product is made in 
compliance with its specifications (qualified person certification in 
the EC).

Sec.  26.2  Purpose.

    The provisions of this subpart govern the exchange between the 
parties and normal endorsement by the receiving regulatory authority of 
official good manufacturing practices (GMP's) inspection reports after a 
transitional period aimed at determination of the equivalence of the 
regulatory systems of the parties, which is the cornerstone of this 
subpart.



Sec.  26.3  Scope.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to pharmaceutical 
inspections carried out in the United States and Member States of the 
European Community (EC) before products are marketed (hereafter referred 
to as ``preapproval inspections'') as well as

[[Page 312]]

during their marketing (hereafter referred to as ``postapproval 
inspections'').
    (b) Appendix A of this subpart names the laws, regulations, and 
administrative provisions governing these inspections and the good 
manufacturing practices (GMP's) requirements.
    (c) Appendix B of this subpart lists the authorities participating 
in activities under this subpart.
    (d) Sections 26.65, 26.66, 26.67, 26.68, 26.69, and 26.70 of subpart 
C of this part do not apply to this subpart.



Sec.  26.4  Product coverage.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart will apply to medicinal products 
for human or animal use, intermediates and starting materials (as 
referred to in the European Community (EC)) and to drugs for human or 
animal use, biological products for human use, and active pharmaceutical 
ingredients (as referred to in the United States), only to the extent 
they are regulated by the authorities of both parties as listed in 
appendix B of this subpart.
    (b) Human blood, human plasma, human tissues and organs, and 
veterinary immunologicals (under 9 CFR 101.2, ``veterinary 
immunologicals'' are referred to as ``veterinary biologicals'') are 
excluded from the scope of this subpart. Human plasma derivatives (such 
as immunoglobulins and albumin), investigational medicinal products/new 
drugs, human radiopharmaceuticals, and medicinal gases are also excluded 
during the transition phase; their situation will be reconsidered at the 
end of the transition period. Products regulated by the Food and Drug 
Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research or Center 
for Drug Evaluation and Research as devices are not covered under this 
subpart.
    (c) Appendix C of this subpart contains an indicative list of 
products covered by this subpart.

[63 FR 60141, Nov. 6, 1998, as amended at 70 FR 14980, Mar. 24, 2005]



Sec.  26.5  Length of transition period.

    A 3-year transition period will start immediately after the 
effective date described in Sec.  26.80(a).



Sec.  26.6  Equivalence assessment.

    (a) The criteria to be used by the parties to assess equivalence are 
listed in appendix D of this subpart. Information pertaining to the 
criteria under European Community (EC) competence will be provided by 
the EC.
    (b) The authorities of the parties will establish and communicate to 
each other their draft programs for assessing the equivalence of the 
respective regulatory systems in terms of quality assurance of the 
products and consumer protection. These programs will be carried out, as 
deemed necessary by the regulatory authorities, for post- and 
preapproval inspections and for various product classes or processes.
    (c) The equivalence assessment shall include information exchanges 
(including inspection reports), joint training, and joint inspections 
for the purpose of assessing regulatory systems and the authorities' 
capabilities. In conducting the equivalence assessment, the parties will 
ensure that efforts are made to save resources.
    (d) Equivalence assessment for authorities added to appendix B of 
this subpart after the effective date described in Sec.  26.80(a) will 
be conducted as described in this subpart, as soon as practicable.



Sec.  26.7  Participation in the equivalence assessment and determination.

    The authorities listed in appendix B of this subpart will actively 
participate in these programs to build a sufficient body of evidence for 
their equivalence determination. Both parties will exercise good faith 
efforts to complete equivalence assessment as expeditiously as possible 
to the extent the resources of the authorities allow.



Sec.  26.8  Other transition activities.

    As soon as possible, the authorities will jointly determine the 
essential information which must be present in inspection reports and 
will cooperate to develop mutually agreed inspection report format(s).

[[Page 313]]



Sec.  26.9  Equivalence determination.

    (a) Equivalence is established by having in place regulatory systems 
covering the criteria referred to in appendix D of this subpart, and a 
demonstrated pattern of consistent performance in accordance with these 
criteria. A list of authorities determined as equivalent shall be agreed 
to by the Joint Sectoral Committee at the end of the transition period, 
with reference to any limitation in terms of inspection type (e.g., 
postapproval or preapproval) or product classes or processes.
    (b) The parties will document insufficient evidence of equivalence, 
lack of opportunity to assess equivalence or a determination of 
nonequivalence, in sufficient detail to allow the authority being 
assessed to know how to attain equivalence.



Sec.  26.10  Regulatory authorities not listed as currently equivalent.

    Authorities not currently listed as equivalent, or not equivalent 
for certain types of inspections, product classes or processes may apply 
for reconsideration of their status once the necessary corrective 
measures have been taken or additional experience is gained.



Sec.  26.11  Start of operational period.

    (a) The operational period shall start at the end of the transition 
period and its provisions apply to inspection reports generated by 
authorities listed as equivalent for the inspections performed in their 
territory.
    (b) In addition, when an authority is not listed as equivalent based 
on adequate experience gained during the transition period, the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) will accept for normal endorsement (as 
provided in Sec.  26.12) inspection reports generated as a result of 
inspections conducted jointly by that authority on its territory and 
another authority listed as equivalent, provided that the authority of 
the Member State in which the inspection is performed can guarantee 
enforcement of the findings of the inspection report and require that 
corrective measures be taken when necessary. FDA has the option to 
participate in these inspections, and based on experience gained during 
the transition period, the parties will agree on procedures for 
exercising this option.
    (c) In the European Community (EC), the qualified person will be 
relieved of responsibility for carrying the controls laid down in 
Article 22 paragraph 1(b) of Council Directive 75/319/EEC (see appendix 
A of this subpart) provided that these controls have been carried out in 
the United States and that each batch/lot is accompanied by a batch 
certificate (in accordance with the World Health Organization 
Certification Scheme on the Quality of Medicinal Products) issued by the 
manufacturer certifying that the product complies with requirements of 
the marketing authorization and signed by the person responsible for 
releasing the batch/lot.



Sec.  26.12  Nature of recognition of inspection reports.

    (a) Inspection reports (containing information as established under 
Sec.  26.8), including a good manufacturing practice (GMP) compliance 
assessment, prepared by authorities listed as equivalent, will be 
provided to the authority of the importing party. Based on the 
determination of equivalence in light of the experience gained, these 
inspection reports will normally be endorsed by the authority of the 
importing party, except under specific and delineated circumstances. 
Examples of such circumstances include indications of material 
inconsistencies or inadequacies in an inspection report, quality defects 
identified in the postmarket surveillance or other specific evidence of 
serious concern in relation to product quality or consumer safety. In 
such cases, the authority of the importing party may request 
clarification from the authority of the exporting party which may lead 
to a request for reinspection. The authorities will endeavor to respond 
to requests for clarification in a timely manner.
    (b) Where divergence is not clarified in this process, an authority 
of the importing country may carry out an inspection of the production 
facility.

[[Page 314]]



Sec.  26.13  Transmission of postapproval inspection reports.

    Postapproval good manufacturing practice (GMP) inspection reports 
concerning products covered by this subpart will be transmitted to the 
authority of the importing country within 60-calendar days of the 
request. Should a new inspection be needed, the inspection report will 
be transmitted within 90-calendar days of the request.



Sec.  26.14  Transmission of preapproval inspection reports.

    (a) A preliminary notification that an inspection may have to take 
place will be made as soon as possible.
    (b) Within 15-calendar days, the relevant authority will acknowledge 
receipt of the request and confirm its ability to carry out the 
inspection. In the European Community (EC), requests will be sent 
directly to the relevant authority, with a copy to the European Agency 
for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA). If the authority 
receiving the request cannot carry out the inspection as requested, the 
requesting authority shall have the right to conduct the inspection.
    (c) Reports of preapproval inspections will be sent within 45-
calendar days of the request that transmitted the appropriate 
information and detailed the precise issues to be addressed during the 
inspection. A shorter time may be necessary in exceptional cases and 
these will be described in the request.



Sec.  26.15  Monitoring continued equivalence.

    Monitoring activities for the purpose of maintaining equivalence 
shall include review of the exchange of inspection reports and their 
quality and timeliness; performance of a limited number of joint 
inspections; and the conduct of common training sessions.



Sec.  26.16  Suspension.

    (a) Each party has the right to contest the equivalence of a 
regulatory authority. This right will be exercised in an objective and 
reasoned manner in writing to the other party.
    (b) The issue shall be discussed in the Joint Sectoral Committee 
promptly upon such notification. Where the Joint Sectoral Committee 
determines that verification of equivalence is required, it may be 
carried out jointly by the parties in a timely manner, under Sec.  26.6.
    (c) Efforts will be made by the Joint Sectoral Committee to reach 
unanimous consent on the appropriate action. If agreement to suspend is 
reached in the Joint Sectoral Committee, an authority may be suspended 
immediately thereafter. If no agreement is reached in the Joint Sectoral 
Committee, the matter is referred to the Joint Committee as described in 
Sec.  26.73. If no unanimous consent is reached within 30 days after 
such notification, the contested authority will be suspended.
    (d) Upon the suspension of authority previously listed as 
equivalent, a party is no longer obligated to normally endorse the 
inspection reports of the suspended authority. A party shall continue to 
normally endorse the inspection reports of that authority prior to 
suspension, unless the authority of the receiving party decides 
otherwise based on health or safety considerations. The suspension will 
remain in effect until unanimous consent has been reached by the parties 
on the future status of that authority.



Sec.  26.17  Role and composition of the Joint Sectoral Committee.

    (a) A Joint Sectoral Committee is set up to monitor the activities 
under both the transitional and operational phases of this subpart.
    (b) The Joint Sectoral Committee will be cochaired by a 
representative of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the United 
States and a representative of the European Community (EC) who each will 
have one vote. Decisions will be taken by unanimous consent.
    (c) The Joint Sectoral Committee's functions will include:
    (1) Making a joint assessment, which must be agreed by both parties, 
of the equivalence of the respective authorities;
    (2) Developing and maintaining the list of equivalent authorities, 
including any limitation in terms of inspecting type or products, and 
communicating

[[Page 315]]

the list to all authorities and the Joint Committee;
    (3) Providing a forum to discuss issues relating to this subpart, 
including concerns that an authority may be no longer equivalent and 
opportunity to review product coverage; and
    (4) Consideration of the issue of suspension.
    (d) The Joint Sectoral Committee shall meet at the request of either 
party and, unless the cochairs otherwise agree, at least once each year. 
The Joint Committee will be kept informed of the agenda and conclusions 
of meetings of the Joint Sectoral Committee.



Sec.  26.18  Regulatory collaboration.

    (a) The parties and authorities shall inform and consult one 
another, as permitted by law, on proposals to introduce new controls or 
to change existing technical regulations or inspection procedures and to 
provide the opportunity to comment on such proposals.
    (b) The parties shall notify each other in writing of any changes to 
appendix B of this subpart.



Sec.  26.19  Information relating to quality aspects.

    The authorities will establish an appropriate means of exchanging 
information on any confirmed problem reports, corrective actions, 
recalls, rejected import consignments, and other regulatory and 
enforcement problems for products subject to this subpart.



Sec.  26.20  Alert system.

    (a) The details of an alert system will be developed during the 
transitional period. The system will be maintained in place at all 
times. Elements to be considered in developing such a system are 
described in appendix E of this subpart.
    (b) Contact points will be agreed between both parties to permit 
authorities to be made aware with the appropriate speed in case of 
quality defect, recalls, counterfeiting, and other problems concerning 
quality, which could necessitate additional controls or suspension of 
the distribution of the product.



Sec.  26.21  Safeguard clause.

    Each party recognizes that the importing country has a right to 
fulfill its legal responsibilities by taking actions necessary to ensure 
the protection of human and animal health at the level of protection it 
deems appropriate. This includes the suspension of the distribution, 
product detention at the border of the importing country, withdrawal of 
the batches and any request for additional information or inspection as 
provided in Sec.  26.12.

with regard to medical devices as conducted by listed conformity 
assessment bodies (CAB's) and to provide for other related cooperative 
activities.
    (b) This subpart is intended to evolve as programs and policies of 
the parties evolve. The parties will review this subpart periodically, 
in order to assess progress and identify potential enhancements to this 
subpart as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Community 
(EC) policies evolve over time.



Sec.  26.32  Scope.

    (a) The provisions of this subpart shall apply to the exchange and, 
where appropriate, endorsement of the following types of reports from 
conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) assessed to be equivalent:
    (1) Under the U.S. system, surveillance/postmarket and initial/
preapproval inspection reports;
    (2) Under the U.S. system, premarket (510(k)) product evaluation 
reports;
    (3) Under the European Community (EC) system, quality system 
evaluation reports; and
    (4) Under the EC system, EC type examination and verification 
reports.
    (b) Appendix A of this subpart names the legislation, regulations, 
and related procedures under which:
    (1) Products are regulated as medical devices by each party;
    (2) CAB's are designated and confirmed; and
    (3) These reports are prepared.
    (c) For purposes of this subpart, equivalence means that: CAB's in 
the EC are capable of conducting product and quality systems evaluations 
against U.S. regulatory requirements in a manner equivalent to those 
conducted by FDA; and CAB's in the United States are capable of 
conducting product and quality systems evaluations against EC regulatory 
requirements in a manner equivalent to those conducted by EC CAB's.



Sec.  26.33  Product coverage.

    (a) There are three components to this subpart each covering a 
discrete range of products:
    (1) Quality System Evaluations. U.S.-type surveillance/postmarket

    The regulatory authorities shall have the responsibility of 
implementing the provisions of this subpart, including the designation 
and monitoring of conformity assessment bodies (CAB's). Regulatory 
authorities will be specified in appendix C of this subpart. Each party 
will promptly notify the other party in writing of any change in the 
regulatory authority for a country.



Sec.  26.35  Length and purpose of transition period.

    There will be a 3-year transition period immediately following the 
date

[[Page 319]]

described in Sec.  26.80(a). During the transition period, the parties 
will engage in confidence-building activities for the purpose of 
obtaining sufficient evidence to make determinations concerning the 
equivalence of conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) of the other party 
with respect to the ability to perform quality system and product 
evaluations or other reviews resulting in reports to be exchanged under 
this subpart.



Sec.  26.36  Listing of CAB's.

    Each party shall designate conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) to 
participate in confidence building activities by transmitting to the 
other party a list of CAB's which meet the criteria for technical 
competence and independence, as identified in appendix A of this 
subpart. The list shall be accompanied by supporting evidence. 
Designated CAB's will be listed in appendix D of this subpart for 
participation in the confidence building activities once confirmed by 
the importing party. Nonconfirmation would have to be justified based on 
documented evidence.



Sec.  26.37  Confidence building activities.

    (a) At the beginning of the transitional period, the Joint Sectoral 
Group will establish a joint confidence building program calculated to 
provide sufficient evidence of the capabilities of the designated 
conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) to perform quality system or 
product evaluations to the specifications of the parties.
    (b) The joint confidence building program should include the 
following actions and activities:
    (1) Seminars designed to inform the parties and CAB's about each 
party's regulatory system, procedures, and requirements;
    (2) Workshops designed to provide the parties with information 
regarding requirements and procedures for the designation and 
surveillance of CAB's;
    (3) Exchange of information about reports prepared during the 
transition period;
    (4) Joint training exercises; and
    (5) Observed inspections.
    (c) During the transition period, any significant problem that is 
identified with a CAB may be the subject of cooperative activities, as 
resources allow and as agreed to by the regulatory authorities, aimed at 
resolving the problem.
    (d) Both parties will exercise good faith efforts to complete the 
confidence building activities as expeditiously as possible to the 
extent that the resources of the parties allow.
    (e) Both the parties will each prepare annual progress reports which 
will describe the confidence building activities undertaken during each 
year of the transition period. The form and content of the reports will 
be determined by the parties through the Joint Sectoral Committee.



Sec.  26.38  Other transition period activities.

    (a) During the transition period, the parties will jointly determine 
the necessary information which must be present in quality system and 
product evaluation reports.
    (b) The parties will jointly develop a notification and alert system 
to be used in case of defects, recalls, and other problems concerning 
product quality that could necessitate additional actions (e.g., 
inspections by the parties of the importing country) or suspension of 
the distribution of the product.



Sec.  26.39  Equivalence assessment.

    (a) In the final 6 months of the transition period, the parties 
shall proceed to a joint assessment of the equivalence of the conformity 
assessment bodies (CAB's) that participated in the confidence building 
activities. CAB's will be determined to be equivalent provided they have 
demonstrated proficiency through the submission of a sufficient number 
of adequate reports. CAB's may be determined to be equivalent with 
regard to the ability to perform any type of quality system or product 
evaluation covered by this subpart and with regard to any type of 
product covered by this subpart. The parties shall develop a list 
contained in appendix E of this subpart of CAB's determined to be 
equivalent, which shall contain a full explanation of the scope of the 
equivalency determination, including any appropriate limitations,

[[Page 320]]

with regard to performing any type of quality system or product 
evaluation.
    (b) The parties shall allow CAB's not listed for participation in 
this subpart, or listed for participation only as to certain types of 
evaluations, to apply for participation in this subpart once the 
necessary measures have been taken or sufficient experience has been 
gained, in accordance with Sec.  26.46.
    (c) Decisions concerning the equivalence of CAB's must be agreed to 
by both parties.



Sec.  26.40  Start of the operational period.

    (a) The operational period will start at the end of the transition 
period after the parties have developed the list of conformity 
assessment bodies (CAB's) found to be equivalent. The provisions of 
Sec. Sec.  26.40, 26.41, 26.42, 26.43, 26.44, 26.45, and 26.46 will 
apply only with regard to listed CAB's and only to the extent of any 
specifications and limitations contained on the list with regard to a 
CAB.
    (b) The operational period will apply to quality system evaluation 
reports and product evaluation reports generated by CAB's listed in 
accordance with this subpart for the evaluations performed in the 
respective territories of the parties, except if the parties agree 
otherwise.



Sec.  26.41  Exchange and endorsement of quality system evaluation reports.

    (a) Listed European Community (EC) conformity assessment bodies 
(CAB's) will provide FDA with reports of quality system evaluations, as 
follows:
    (1) For preapproval quality system evaluations, EC CAB's will 
provide full reports; and
    (2) For surveillance quality system evaluations, EC CAB's will 
provide abbreviated reports.
    (b) Listed U.S. CAB's will provide to the EC Notified Body of the 
manufacturer's choice:
    (1) Full reports of initial quality system evaluations;
    (2) Abbreviated reports of quality systems surveillance audits.
    (c) If the abbreviated reports do not provide sufficient 
information, the importing party may request additional clarification 
from the CAB.
    (d) Based on the determination of equivalence in light of the 
experience gained, the quality system evaluation reports prepared by the 
CAB's listed as equivalent will normally be endorsed by the importing 
party, except under specific and delineated circumstances. Examples of 
such circumstances include indications of material inconsistencies or 
inadequacies in a report, quality defects identified in postmarket 
surveillance or other specific evidence of serious concern in relation 
to product quality or consumer safety. In such cases, the importing 
party may request clarification from the exporting party which may lead 
to a request for reinspection. The parties will endeavor to respond to 
requests for clarification in a timely manner. Where divergence is not 
clarified in this process, the importing party may carry out the quality 
system evaluation.



Sec.  26.42  Exchange and endorsement of product evaluation reports.

    (a) European Community (EC) conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) 
listed for this purpose will, subject to the specifications and 
limitations on the list, provide to FDA 510(k) premarket notification 
assessment reports prepared to U.S. medical device requirements.
    (b) U.S. CAB's will, subject to the specifications and limitations 
on the list, provide to the EC Notified Body of the manufacturer's 
choice, type examination, and verification reports prepared to EC 
medical device requirements.
    (c) Based on the determination of equivalence in light of the 
experience gained, the product evaluation reports prepared by the CAB's 
listed as equivalent will normally be endorsed by the importing party, 
except under specific and delineated circumstances. Examples of such 
circumstances include indications of material inconsistencies, 
inadequacies, or incompleteness in a product evaluation report, or other 
specific evidence of serious concern in relation to product safety, 
performance, or quality. In such cases, the importing party may request 
clarification from the exporting party which may lead to a request for a 
reevaluation.

[[Page 321]]

The parties will endeavor to respond to requests for clarification in a 
timely manner. Endorsement remains the responsibility of the importing 
party.



Sec.  26.43  Transmission of quality system evaluation reports.

    Quality system evaluation reports covered by Sec.  26.41 concerning 
products covered by this subpart shall be transmitted to the importing 
party within 60-calendar days of a request by the importing party. 
Should a new inspection be requested, the time period shall be extended 
by an additional 30-calendar days. A party may request a new inspection, 
for cause, identified to the other party. If the exporting party cannot 
perform an inspection within a specified period of time, the importing 
party may perform an inspection on its own.



Sec.  26.44  Transmission of product evaluation reports.

    Transmission of product evaluation reports will take place according 
to the importing party's specified procedures.



Sec.  26.45  Monitoring continued equivalence.

    Monitoring activities will be carried out in accordance with Sec.  
26.69.



Sec.  26.46  Listing of additional CAB's.

    (a) During the operational period, additional conformity assessment 
bodies (CAB's) will be considered for equivalence using the procedures 
and criteria described in Sec. Sec.  26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, taking 
into account the level of confidence gained in the overall regulatory 
system of the other party.
    (b) Once a designating authority considers that such CAB's, having 
undergone the procedures of Sec. Sec.  26.36, 26.37, and 26.39, may be 
determined to be equivalent, it will then designate those bodies on an 
annual basis. Such procedures satisfy the procedures of Sec.  26.66(a) 
and (b).
    (c) Following such annual designations, the procedures for 
confirmation of CAB's under Sec.  26.66(c) and (d) shall apply.



Sec.  26.47  Role and composition of the Joint Sectoral Committee.

    (a) The Joint Sectoral Committee for this subpart is set up to 
monitor the activities under both the transitional and operational 
phases of this subpart.
    (b) The Joint Sectoral Committee will be cochaired by a 
representative of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the United 
States and a representative of the European Community (EC) who will each 
have one vote. Decisions will be taken by unanimous consent.
    (c) The Joint Sectoral Committee's functions will include:
    (1) Making a joint assessment of the equivalence of conformity 
assessment bodies (CAB's);
    (2) Developing and maintaining the list of equivalent CAB's, 
including any limitation in terms of their scope of activities and 
communicating the list to all authorities and the Joint Committee 
described in subpart C of this part;
    (3) Providing a forum to discuss issues relating to this subpart, 
including concerns that a CAB may no longer be equivalent and 
opportunity to review product coverage; and
    (4) Consideration of the issue of suspension.



Sec.  26.48  Harmonization.

    During both the transitional and operational phases of this subpart, 
both parties intend to continue to participate in the activities of the 
Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) and utilize the results of those 
activities to the extent possible. Such participation involves 
developing and reviewing documents developed by the GHTF and jointly 
determining whether they are applicable to the implementation of this 
subpart.



Sec.  26.49  Regulatory cooperation.

    (a) The parties and authorities shall inform and consult with one 
another, as permitted by law, of proposals to introduce new controls or 
to change existing technical regulations or inspection procedures and to 
provide the opportunity to comment on such proposals.

[[Page 322]]

    (b) The parties shall notify each other in writing of any changes to 
appendix A of this subpart.



Sec.  26.50  Alert system and exchange of postmarket vigilance reports.

    (a) An alert system will be set up during the transition period and 
maintained thereafter by which the parties will notify each other when 
there is an immediate danger to public health. Elements of such a system 
will be described in an appendix F of this subpart. As part of that 
system, each party shall notify the other party of any confirmed problem 
reports, corrective actions, or recalls. These reports are regarded as 
part of ongoing investigations.
    (b) Contact points will be agreed between both parties to permit 
authorities to be made aware with the appropriate speed in case of 
quality defect, batch recalls, counterfeiting and other problems 
concerning quality, which could necessitate additional controls or 
suspension of the distribution of the product.

         Sec. Appendixes C-F to Subpart B of Part 26 [Reserved]



                   Subpart C_``Framework'' Provisions



Sec.  26.60  Definitions.

    (a) The following terms and definitions shall apply to this subpart 
only:
    (1) Designating Authority means a body with power to designate, 
monitor, suspend, remove suspension of, or withdraw conformity 
assessment bodies as specified under this part.
    (2) Designation means the identification by a designating authority 
of a conformity assessment body to perform conformity assessment 
procedures under this part.
    (3) Regulatory Authority means a government agency or entity that 
exercises a legal right to control the use or sale of products within a 
party's jurisdiction and may take enforcement action to ensure that 
products marketed within its jurisdiction comply with legal 
requirements.
    (b) Other terms concerning conformity assessment used in this part 
shall have the meaning given elsewhere in this part or in the 
definitions contained in ``Guide 2: Standardization and Related 
Activities--General Vocabulary of the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC)'' (ISO/IEC Guide 2) (1996 edition), which is incorporated by 
reference in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies 
are available from the International Organization for Standardization, 
1, rue de Varemb[eacute], Case postale 56, CH-1211 Gen[egrave]ve 20, 
Switzerland, or on the Internet at http://www.iso.ch or may be examined 
at the Food and Drug Administration's Medical Library, 5600 Fishers 
Lane, rm. 11B-40, Rockville, MD 20857, or at the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of 
this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http://
www.archives.gov/federal--register/code--of--federal--regulations/ibr--
locations.html. In the event of an inconsistency between the ISO/IEC 
Guide 2 and definitions in this part, the definitions in this part shall 
prevail.



Sec.  26.61  Purpose of this part.

    This part specifies the conditions by which each party will accept 
or recognize results of conformity assessment

[[Page 335]]

procedures, produced by the other party's conformity assessment bodies 
(CAB's) or authorities, in assessing conformity to the importing party's 
requirements, as specified on a sector-specific basis in subparts A and 
B of this part, and to provide for other related cooperative activities. 
The objective of such mutual recognition is to provide effective market 
access throughout the territories of the parties with regard to 
conformity assessment for all products covered under this part. If any 
obstacles to such access arise, consultations will promptly be held. In 
the absence of a satisfactory outcome of such consultations, the party 
alleging its market access has been denied may, within 90 days of such 
consultation, invoke its right to terminate the ``Agreement on Mutual 
Recognition Between the United States of America and the European 
Community,'' from which this part is derived, in accordance with Sec.  
26.80.



Sec.  26.62  General obligations.

    (a) The United States shall, as specified in subparts A and B of 
this part, accept or recognize results of specified procedures, used in 
assessing conformity to specified legislative, regulatory, and 
administrative provisions of the United States, produced by the other 
party's conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) and/or authorities.
    (b) The European Community (EC) and its Member States shall, as 
specified in subparts A and B of this part, accept or recognize results 
of specified procedures, used in assessing conformity to specified 
legislative, regulatory, and administrative provisions of the EC and its 
Member States, produced by the other party's CAB's and/or authorities.
    (c) Where sectoral transition arrangements have been specified in 
subparts A and B of this part, the obligations in paragraphs (a) and (b) 
of this section will apply following the successful completion of those 
sectoral transition arrangements, with the understanding that the 
conformity assessment procedures utilized assure conformity to the 
satisfaction of the receiving party, with applicable legislative, 
regulatory, and administrative provisions of that party, equivalent to 
the assurance offered by the receiving party's own procedures.



Sec.  26.63  General coverage of this part.

    (a) This part applies to conformity assessment procedures for 
products and/or processes and to other related cooperative activities as 
described in this part.
    (b) Subparts A and B of this part may include:
    (1) A description of the relevant legislative, regulatory, and 
administrative provisions pertaining to the conformity assessment 
procedures and technical regulations;
    (2) A statement on the product scope and coverage;
    (3) A list of designating authorities;
    (4) A list of agreed conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) or 
authorities or a source from which to obtain a list of such bodies or 
authorities and a statement of the scope of the conformity assessment 
procedures for which each has been agreed;

Sec.  26.65  Designating authorities.

    The parties shall ensure that the designating authorities specified 
in subpart B of this part have the power and competence in their 
respective territories to carry out decisions under this part to 
designate, monitor, suspend, remove suspension of, or withdraw 
conformity assessment bodies (CAB's).



Sec.  26.66  Designation and listing procedures.

    The following procedures shall apply with regard to the designation 
of conformity assessment bodies (CAB's) and the inclusion of such bodies 
in the list of CAB's in subpart B of this part:
    (a) The designating authority identified in subpart B of this part 
shall designate CAB's in accordance with the procedures and criteria set 
forth in subpart B of this part;
    (b) A party proposing to add a CAB to the list of such bodies in 
subpart B of this part shall forward its proposal of one or more 
designated CAB's in writing to the other party with a view to a decision 
by the Joint Committee;
    (c) Within 60 days following receipt of the proposal, the other 
party shall indicate its position regarding either its confirmation or 
its opposition. Upon confirmation, the inclusion in subpart B of this 
part of the proposed CAB or CAB's shall take effect; and
    (d) In the event that the other party contests on the basis of 
documented evidence the technical competence or compliance of a proposed 
CAB, or indicates in writing that it requires an additional 30 days to 
more fully verify such evidence, such CAB shall not be included on the 
list of CAB's in subpart B of this part. In this instance, the Joint 
Committee may decide that the body concerned be verified. After the 
completion of such verification, the proposal to list the CAB in subpart 
B may be resubmitted to the other party.



Sec.  26.67  Suspension of listed conformity assessment bodies.

    The following procedures shall apply with regard to the suspension 
of a conformity assessment body (CAB) listed in subpart B of this part.
    (a) A party shall notify the other party of its contestation of the 
technical competence or compliance of a CAB listed in subpart B of this 
part and the contesting party's intent to suspend such CAB. Such 
contestation shall be exercised when justified in an objective and 
reasoned manner in writing to the other party;
    (b) The CAB shall be given prompt notice by the other party and an 
opportunity to present information in order to refute the contestation 
or to correct the deficiencies which form the basis of the contestation;
    (c) Any such contestation shall be discussed between the parties in 
the Joint Sectoral Committee described in subpart B of this part. If 
there is no Joint Sectoral Committee, the contesting party shall refer 
the matter directly to the Joint Committee. If agreement to suspend is 
reached by the Joint Sectoral Committee or, if there is no Joint 
Sectoral Committee, by the Joint Committee, the CAB shall be suspended;
    (d) Where the Joint Sectoral Committee or Joint Committee decides 
that verification of technical competence or compliance is required, it 
shall normally be carried out in a timely manner by the party in whose 
territory the body in question is located, but may be carried out 
jointly by the parties in justified cases;
    (e) If the matter has not been resolved by the Joint Sectoral 
Committee within 10 days of the notice of contestation, the matter shall 
be referred to the Joint Committee for a decision. If there is no Joint 
Sectoral Committee, the matter shall be referred directly to the Joint 
Committee. If no decision is reached by the Joint Committee within 10 
days of the referral to it, the CAB shall be suspended upon the request 
of the contesting party;
    (f) Upon the suspension of a CAB listed in subpart B of this part, a 
party is

[[Page 337]]

no longer obligated to accept or recognize the results of conformity 
assessment procedures performed by that CAB subsequent to suspension. A 
party shall continue to accept the results of conformity assessment 
procedures performed by that CAB prior to suspension, unless a 
regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, 
safety or environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other 
requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part; and
    (g) The suspension shall remain in effect until agreement has been 
reached by the parties upon the future status of that body.

from subpart B of this part of a conformity assessment body (CAB):
    (a) A party proposing to withdraw a CAB listed in subpart B of this 
part shall forward its proposal in writing to the other party;
    (b) Such CAB shall be promptly notified by the other party and shall 
be provided a period of at least 30 days from receipt to provide 
information in order to refute or to correct the deficiencies which form 
the basis of the proposed withdrawal;
    (c) Within 60 days following receipt of the proposal, the other 
party shall indicate its position regarding either its confirmation or 
its opposition. Upon confirmation, the withdrawal from the list in 
subpart B of this part of the CAB shall take effect;
    (d) In the event the other party opposes the proposal to withdraw by 
supporting the technical competence and compliance of the CAB, the CAB 
shall not at that time be withdrawn from the list of CAB's in subpart B 
of this part. In this instance, the Joint Sectoral Committee or the 
Joint Committee may decide to carry out a joint verification of the body 
concerned. After the completion of such verification, the proposal for 
withdrawal of the CAB may be resubmitted to the other party; and
    (e) Subsequent to the withdrawal of a CAB listed in subpart B of 
this part, a party shall continue to accept the results of conformity 
assessment procedures performed by that CAB prior to withdrawal, unless 
a regulatory authority of the party decides otherwise based on health, 
safety, and environmental considerations or failure to satisfy other 
requirements within the scope of subpart B of this part.

with a view to preserving the remaining Sectoral Annexes, in accordance 
with the procedures in this section. Failing such consensus, that 
agreement shall terminate at the end of 6 months from the date of 
notice.
    (d) Following termination of that agreement in its entirety or any 
individual sectoral annex thereof, a party to that agreement shall 
continue to accept the results of conformity assessment procedures 
performed by conformity assessment bodies under that agreement prior to 
termination, unless a regulatory authority in the party decides 
otherwise based on health, safety and environmental considerations or 
failure to satisfy other requirements within the scope of the applicable 
sectoral annex.



Sec.  26.81  Final provisions.

    (a) The sectoral annexes referred to in Sec.  26.80(a), as well as

              Subpart B_Informed Consent of Human Subjects

    Source: 46 FR 8951, Jan. 27, 1981, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  50.20  General requirements for informed consent.

    Except as provided in Sec. Sec.  50.23 and 50.24, no investigator 
may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by these 
regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective 
informed consent of the subject or the subject's legally authorized 
representative. An investigator shall seek such consent only under 
circumstances that provide the prospective subject or the representative 
sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to participate and 
that minimize

[[Page 344]]

the possibility of coercion or undue influence. The information that is 
given to the subject or the representative shall be in language 
understandable to the subject or the representative. No informed 
consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language 
through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or 
appear to waive any of the subject's legal rights, or releases or 
appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or 
its agents from liability for negligence.

[46 FR 8951, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 64 FR 10942, Mar. 8, 1999]



Sec.  50.23  Exception from general requirements.

    (a) The obtaining of informed consent shall be deemed feasible 
unless, before use of the test article (except as provided in paragraph 
(b) of this section), both the investigator and a physician who is not 
otherwise participating in the clinical investigation certify in writing 
all of the following:
    (1) The human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation 
necessitating the use of the test article.
    (2) Informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because of 
an inability to communicate with, or obtain legally effective consent 
from, the subject.
    (3) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's 
legal representative.
    (4) There is available no alternative method of approved or 
generally recognized therapy that provides an equal or greater 
likelihood of saving the life of the subject.
    (b) If immediate use of the test article is, in the investigator's 
opinion, required to preserve the life of the subject, and time is not 
sufficient to obtain the independent determination required in paragraph 
(a) of this section in advance of using the test article, the 
determinations of the clinical investigator shall be made and, within 5 
working days after the use of the article, be reviewed and evaluated in 
writing by a physician who is not participating in the clinical 
investigation.
    (c) The documentation required in paragraph (a) or (b) of this 
section shall be submitted to the IRB within 5 working days after the 
use of the test article.
    (d)(1) Under 10 U.S.C. 1107(f) the President may waive the prior 
consent requirement for the administration of an investigational new 
drug to a member of the armed forces in connection with the member's 
participation in a particular military operation. The statute specifies 
that only the President may waive informed consent in this connection 
and the President may grant such a waiver only if the President 
determines in writing that obtaining consent: Is not feasible; is 
contrary to the best interests of the military member; or is not in the 
interests of national security. The statute further provides that in 
making a determination to waive prior informed consent on the ground 
that it is not feasible or the ground that it is contrary to the best 
interests of the military members involved, the President shall apply 
the standards and criteria that are set forth in the relevant FDA 
regulations for a waiver of the prior informed consent requirements of 
section 505(i)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 
355(i)(4)). Before such a determination may be made that obtaining 
informed consent from military personnel prior to the use of an 
investigational drug (including an antibiotic or biological product) in 
a specific protocol under an investigational new drug application (IND) 
sponsored by the Department of Defense (DOD) and limited to specific 
military personnel involved in a particular military operation is not 
feasible or is contrary to the best interests of the military members 
involved the Secretary of Defense must first request such a 
determination from the President, and certify and document to the 
President that the following standards and criteria contained in 
paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section have been met.
    (i) The extent and strength of evidence of the safety and 
effectiveness of the investigational new drug in relation to the medical 
risk that could be encountered during the military operation supports 
the drug's administration under an IND.

[[Page 345]]

    (ii) The military operation presents a substantial risk that 
military personnel may be subject to a chemical, biological, nuclear, or 
other exposure likely to produce death or serious or life-threatening 
injury or illness.
    (iii) There is no available satisfactory alternative therapeutic or 
preventive treatment in relation to the intended use of the 
investigational new drug.
    (iv) Conditioning use of the investigational new drug on the 
voluntary participation of each member could significantly risk the 
safety and health of any individual member who would decline its use, 
the safety of other military personnel, and the accomplishment of the 
military mission.
    (v) A duly constituted institutional review board (IRB) established 
and operated in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2) 
and (d)(3) of this section, responsible for review of the study, has 
reviewed and approved the investigational new drug protocol and the 
administration of the investigational new drug without informed consent. 
DOD's request is to include the documentation required by Sec.  
56.115(a)(2) of this chapter.
    (vi) DOD has explained:
    (A) The context in which the investigational drug will be 
administered, e.g., the setting or whether it will be self-administered 
or it will be administered by a health professional;
    (B) The nature of the disease or condition for which the preventive 
or therapeutic treatment is intended; and
    (C) To the extent there are existing data or information available, 
information on conditions that could alter the effects of the 
investigational drug.
    (vii) DOD's recordkeeping system is capable of tracking and will be 
used to track the proposed treatment from supplier to the individual 
recipient.
    (viii) Each member involved in the military operation will be given, 
prior to the administration of the investigational new drug, a specific 
written information sheet (including information required by 10 U.S.C. 
1107(d)) concerning the investigational new drug, the risks and benefits 
of its use, potential side effects, and other pertinent information 
about the appropriate use of the product.
    (ix) Medical records of members involved in the military operation 
will accurately document the receipt by members of the notification 
required by paragraph (d)(1)(viii) of this section.
    (x) Medical records of members involved in the military operation 
will accurately document the receipt by members of any investigational 
new drugs in accordance with FDA regulations including part 312 of this 
chapter.
    (xi) DOD will provide adequate followup to assess whether there are 
beneficial or adverse health consequences that result from the use of 
the investigational product.
    (xii) DOD is pursuing drug development, including a time line, and 
marketing approval with due diligence.
    (xiii) FDA has concluded that the investigational new drug protocol 
may proceed subject to a decision by the President on the informed 
consent waiver request.
    (xiv) DOD will provide training to the appropriate medical personnel 
and potential recipients on the specific investigational new drug to be 
administered prior to its use.
    (xv) DOD has stated and justified the time period for which the 
waiver is needed, not to exceed one year, unless separately renewed 
under these standards and criteria.
    (xvi) DOD shall have a continuing obligation to report to the FDA 
and to the President any changed circumstances relating to these 
standards and criteria (including the time period referred to in 
paragraph (d)(1)(xv) of this section) or that otherwise might affect the 
determination to use an investigational new drug without informed 
consent.
    (xvii) DOD is to provide public notice as soon as practicable and 
consistent with classification requirements through notice in the 
Federal Register describing each waiver of informed consent 
determination, a summary of the most updated scientific information on 
the products used, and other pertinent information.
    (xviii) Use of the investigational drug without informed consent 
otherwise conforms with applicable law.
    (2) The duly constituted institutional review board, described in 
paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, must include at

[[Page 346]]

least 3 nonaffiliated members who shall not be employees or officers of 
the Federal Government (other than for purposes of membership on the 
IRB) and shall be required to obtain any necessary security clearances. 
This IRB shall review the proposed IND protocol at a convened meeting at 
which a majority of the members are present including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas and, if 
feasible, including a majority of the nonaffiliated members. The 
information required by Sec.  56.115(a)(2) of this chapter is to be 
provided to the Secretary of Defense for further review.
    (3) The duly constituted institutional review board, described in 
paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section, must review and approve:
    (i) The required information sheet;
    (ii) The adequacy of the plan to disseminate information, including 
distribution of the information sheet to potential recipients, on the 
investigational product (e.g., in forms other than written);
    (iii) The adequacy of the information and plans for its 
dissemination to health care providers, including potential side 
effects, contraindications, potential interactions, and other pertinent 
considerations; and
    (iv) An informed consent form as required by part 50 of this 
chapter, in those circumstances in which DOD determines that informed 
consent may be obtained from some or all personnel involved.
    (4) DOD is to submit to FDA summaries of institutional review board 
meetings at which the proposed protocol has been reviewed.
    (5) Nothing in these criteria or standards is intended to preempt or 
limit FDA's and DOD's authority or obligations under applicable statutes 
and regulations.
    (e)(1) Obtaining informed consent for investigational in vitro 
diagnostic devices used to identify chemical, biological, radiological, 
or nuclear agents will be deemed feasible unless, before use of the test 
article, both the investigator (e.g., clinical laboratory director or 
other responsible individual) and a physician who is not otherwise 
participating in the clinical investigation make the determinations and 
later certify in writing all of the following:
    (i) The human subject is confronted by a life-threatening situation 
necessitating the use of the investigational in vitro diagnostic device 
to identify a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent that 
would suggest a terrorism event or other public health emergency.
    (ii) Informed consent cannot be obtained from the subject because:
    (A) There was no reasonable way for the person directing that the 
specimen be collected to know, at the time the specimen was collected, 
that there would be a need to use the investigational in vitro 
diagnostic device on that subject's specimen; and
    (B) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject 
without risking the life of the subject.
    (iii) Time is not sufficient to obtain consent from the subject's 
legally authorized representative.
    (iv) There is no cleared or approved available alternative method of 
diagnosis, to identify the chemical, biological, radiological, or 
nuclear agent that provides an equal or greater likelihood of saving the 
life of the subject.
    (2) If use of the investigational device is, in the opinion of the 
investigator (e.g., clinical laboratory director or other responsible 
person), required to preserve the life of the subject, and time is not 
sufficient to obtain the independent determination required in paragraph 
(e)(1) of this section in advance of using the investigational device, 
the determinations of the investigator shall be made and, within 5 
working days after the use of the device, be reviewed and evaluated in 
writing by a physician who is not participating in the clinical 
investigation.
    (3) The investigator must submit the written certification of the 
determinations made by the investigator and an independent physician 
required in paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section to the IRB and 
FDA within 5 working days after the use of the device.
    (4) An investigator must disclose the investigational status of the 
in vitro diagnostic device and what is known about the performance 
characteristics of the device in the report to the subject's health care 
provider and in any

[[Page 347]]

report to public health authorities. The investigator must provide the 
IRB with the information required in Sec.  50.25 (except for the 
information described in Sec.  50.25(a)(8)) and the procedures that will 
be used to provide this information to each subject or the subject's 
legally authorized representative at the time the test results are 
provided to the subject's health care provider and public health 
authorities.
    (5) The IRB is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of the 
information required in section 50.25 (except for the information 
described in Sec.  50.25(a)(8)) and for ensuring that procedures are in 
place to provide this information to each subject or the subject's 
legally authorized representative.
    (6) No State or political subdivision of a State may establish or 
continue in effect any law, rule, regulation or other requirement that 
informed consent be obtained before an investigational in vitro 
diagnostic device may be used to identify chemical, biological, 
radiological, or nuclear agent in suspected terrorism events and other 
potential public health emergencies that is different from, or in 
addition to, the requirements of this regulation.

Sec.  50.24  Exception from informed consent requirements for
emergency research.

    (a) The IRB responsible for the review, approval, and continuing 
review of the clinical investigation described in this section may 
approve that investigation without requiring that informed consent of 
all research subjects be obtained if the IRB (with the concurrence of a 
licensed physician who is a member of or consultant to the IRB and who 
is not otherwise participating in the clinical investigation) finds and 
documents each of the following:
    (1) The human subjects are in a life-threatening situation, 
available treatments are unproven or unsatisfactory, and the collection 
of valid scientific evidence, which may include evidence obtained 
through randomized placebo-controlled investigations, is necessary to 
determine the safety and effectiveness of particular interventions.
    (2) Obtaining informed consent is not feasible because:
    (i) The subjects will not be able to give their informed consent as 
a result of their medical condition;
    (ii) The intervention under investigation must be administered 
before consent from the subjects' legally authorized representatives is 
feasible; and
    (iii) There is no reasonable way to identify prospectively the 
individuals likely to become eligible for participation in the clinical 
investigation.
    (3) Participation in the research holds out the prospect of direct 
benefit to the subjects because:
    (i) Subjects are facing a life-threatening situation that 
necessitates intervention;
    (ii) Appropriate animal and other preclinical studies have been 
conducted, and the information derived from those studies and related 
evidence support the potential for the intervention to provide a direct 
benefit to the individual subjects; and
    (iii) Risks associated with the investigation are reasonable in 
relation to what is known about the medical condition of the potential 
class of subjects, the risks and benefits of standard therapy, if any, 
and what is known about the risks and benefits of the proposed 
intervention or activity.
    (4) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out 
without the waiver.
    (5) The proposed investigational plan defines the length of the 
potential therapeutic window based on scientific evidence, and the 
investigator has committed to attempting to contact a legally authorized 
representative for each subject within that window of time and, if 
feasible, to asking the legally authorized representative contacted for 
consent within that window rather than proceeding without consent. The 
investigator will summarize efforts made to contact legally authorized 
representatives and make this information available to the IRB at the 
time of continuing review.
    (6) The IRB has reviewed and approved informed consent procedures 
and an informed consent document

[[Page 348]]

consistent with Sec.  50.25. These procedures and the informed consent 
document are to be used with subjects or their legally authorized 
representatives in situations where use of such procedures and documents 
is feasible. The IRB has reviewed and approved procedures and 
information to be used when providing an opportunity for a family member 
to object to a subject's participation in the clinical investigation 
consistent with paragraph (a)(7)(v) of this section.
    (7) Additional protections of the rights and welfare of the subjects 
will be provided, including, at least:
    (i) Consultation (including, where appropriate, consultation carried 
out by the IRB) with representatives of the communities in which the 
clinical investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects 
will be drawn;
    (ii) Public disclosure to the communities in which the clinical 
investigation will be conducted and from which the subjects will be 
drawn, prior to initiation of the clinical investigation, of plans for 
the investigation and its risks and expected benefits;
    (iii) Public disclosure of sufficient information following 
completion of the clinical investigation to apprise the community and 
researchers of the study, including the demographic characteristics of 
the research population, and its results;
    (iv) Establishment of an independent data monitoring committee to 
exercise oversight of the clinical investigation; and
    (v) If obtaining informed consent is not feasible and a legally 
authorized representative is not reasonably available, the investigator 
has committed, if feasible, to attempting to contact within the 
therapeutic window the subject's family member who is not a legally 
authorized representative, and asking whether he or she objects to the 
subject's participation in the clinical investigation. The investigator 
will summarize efforts made to contact family members and make this 
information available to the IRB at the time of continuing review.
    (b) The IRB is responsible for ensuring that procedures are in place 
to inform, at the earliest feasible opportunity, each subject, or if the 
subject remains incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of 
the subject, or if such a representative is not reasonably available, a 
family member, of the subject's inclusion in the clinical investigation, 
the details of the investigation and other information contained in the 
informed consent document. The IRB shall also ensure that there is a 
procedure to inform the subject, or if the subject remains 
incapacitated, a legally authorized representative of the subject, or if 
such a representative is not reasonably available, a family member, that 
he or she may discontinue the subject's participation at any time 
without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise 
entitled. If a legally authorized representative or family member is 
told about the clinical investigation and the subject's condition 
improves, the subject is also to be informed as soon as feasible. If a 
subject is entered into a clinical investigation with waived consent and 
the subject dies before a legally authorized representative or family 
member can be contacted, information about the clinical investigation is 
to be provided to the subject's legally authorized representative or 
family member, if feasible.
    (c) The IRB determinations required by paragraph (a) of this section 
and the documentation required by paragraph (e) of this section are to 
be retained by the IRB for at least 3 years after completion of the 
clinical investigation, and the records shall be accessible for 
inspection and copying by FDA in accordance with Sec.  56.115(b) of this 
chapter.
    (d) Protocols involving an exception to the informed consent 
requirement under this section must be performed under a separate 
investigational new drug application (IND) or investigational device 
exemption (IDE) that clearly identifies such protocols as protocols that 
may include subjects who are unable to consent. The submission of those 
protocols in a separate IND/IDE is required even if an IND for the same 
drug product or an IDE for the same device already exists. Applications 
for investigations under this section may not be submitted as amendments 
under Sec. Sec.  312.30 or 812.35 of this chapter.

[[Page 349]]

    (e) If an IRB determines that it cannot approve a clinical 
investigation because the investigation does not meet the criteria in 
the exception provided under paragraph (a) of this section or because of 
other relevant ethical concerns, the IRB must document its findings and 
provide these findings promptly in writing to the clinical investigator 
and to the sponsor of the clinical investigation. The sponsor of the 
clinical investigation must promptly disclose this information to FDA 
and to the sponsor's clinical investigators who are participating or are 
asked to participate in this or a substantially equivalent clinical 
investigation of the sponsor, and to other IRB's that have been, or are, 
asked to review this or a substantially equivalent investigation by that 
sponsor.

[61 FR 51528, Oct. 2, 1996]

 Subpart D_Additional Safeguards for Children in Clinical Investigations

    Source: 66 FR 20598, Apr. 24, 2001, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  50.50  IRB duties.

    In addition to other responsibilities assigned to IRBs under this 
part and part 56 of this chapter, each IRB must review clinical 
investigations involving children as subjects covered by this subpart D 
and approve only those clinical investigations that satisfy the criteria 
described in Sec.  50.51, Sec.  50.52, or Sec.  50.53 and the conditions 
of all other applicable sections of this subpart D.



Sec.  50.51  Clinical investigations not involving greater than
minimal risk.

    Any clinical investigation within the scope described in Sec. Sec.  
50.1 and 56.101 of this chapter in which no greater than minimal risk to 
children is presented may involve children as subjects only if the IRB 
finds that:
    (a) No greater than minimal risk to children is presented; and
    (b) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the 
children and the permission of their parents or guardians as set forth 
in Sec.  50.55.

[78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  50.52  Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal
risk but presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects.

    Any clinical investigation within the scope described in Sec. Sec.  
50.1 and 56.101 of this chapter in which more than minimal risk to 
children is presented by an intervention or procedure that holds out the 
prospect of direct benefit for

[[Page 351]]

the individual subject, or by a monitoring procedure that is likely to 
contribute to the subject's well-being, may involve children as subjects 
only if the IRB finds that:
    (a) The risk is justified by the anticipated benefit to the 
subjects;
    (b) The relation of the anticipated benefit to the risk is at least 
as favorable to the subjects as that presented by available alternative 
approaches; and
    (c) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the 
children and permission of their parents or guardians as set forth in 
Sec.  50.55.

[66 FR 20598, Apr. 24, 2001, as amended at 78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  50.53  Clinical investigations involving greater than minimal 
risk and no prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects, but likely
to yield generalizable knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition.

    Any clinical investigation within the scope described in Sec. Sec.  
50.1 and 56.101 of this chapter in which more than minimal risk to 
children is presented by an intervention or procedure that does not hold 
out the prospect of direct benefit for the individual subject, or by a 
monitoring procedure that is not likely to contribute to the well-being 
of the subject, may involve children as subjects only if the IRB finds 
that:
    (a) The risk represents a minor increase over minimal risk;
    (b) The intervention or procedure presents experiences to subjects 
that are reasonably commensurate with those inherent in their actual or 
expected medical, dental, psychological, social, or educational 
situations;
    (c) The intervention or procedure is likely to yield generalizable 
knowledge about the subjects' disorder or condition that is of vital 
importance for the understanding or amelioration of the subjects' 
disorder or condition; and
    (d) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the 
children and permission of their parents or guardians as set forth in 
Sec.  50.55.

[66 FR 20598, Apr. 24, 2001, as amended at 78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  50.54  Clinical investigations not otherwise approvable that
present an opportunity to understand, prevent, or alleviate a serious
problem affecting the health or welfare of children.

    If an IRB does not believe that a clinical investigation within the 
scope described in Sec. Sec.  50.1 and 56.101 of this chapter and 
involving children as subjects meets the requirements of Sec.  50.51, 
Sec.  50.52, or Sec.  50.53, the clinical investigation may proceed only 
if:
    (a) The IRB finds that the clinical investigation presents a 
reasonable opportunity to further the understanding, prevention, or 
alleviation of a serious problem affecting the health or welfare of 
children; and
    (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, after consultation with a 
panel of experts in pertinent disciplines (for example: science, 
medicine, education, ethics, law) and following opportunity for public 
review and comment, determines either:
    (1) That the clinical investigation in fact satisfies the conditions 
of Sec.  50.51, Sec.  50.52, or Sec.  50.53, as applicable, or
    (2) That the following conditions are met:
    (i) The clinical investigation presents a reasonable opportunity to 
further the understanding, prevention, or alleviation of a serious 
problem affecting the health or welfare of children;
    (ii) The clinical investigation will be conducted in accordance with 
sound ethical principles; and
    (iii) Adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of 
children and the permission of their parents or guardians as set forth 
in Sec.  50.55.

[66 FR 20598, Apr. 24, 2001, as amended at 78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  50.55  Requirements for permission by parents or guardians 
and for assent by children.

    (a) In addition to the determinations required under other 
applicable sections of this subpart D, the IRB must determine that 
adequate provisions are made for soliciting the assent of the children 
when in the judgment of the IRB the children are capable of providing 
assent.
    (b) In determining whether children are capable of providing assent, 
the

[[Page 352]]

IRB must take into account the ages, maturity, and psychological state 
of the children involved. This judgment may be made for all children to 
be involved in clinical investigations under a particular protocol, or 
for each child, as the IRB deems appropriate.
    (c) The assent of the children is not a necessary condition for 
proceeding with the clinical investigation if the IRB determines:
    (1) That the capability of some or all of the children is so limited 
that they cannot reasonably be consulted, or
    (2) That the intervention or procedure involved in the clinical 
investigation holds out a prospect of direct benefit that is important 
to the health or well-being of the children and is available only in the 
context of the clinical investigation.
    (d) Even where the IRB determines that the subjects are capable of 
assenting, the IRB may still waive the assent requirement if it finds 
and documents that:
    (1) The clinical investigation involves no more than minimal risk to 
the subjects;
    (2) The waiver will not adversely affect the rights and welfare of 
the subjects;
    (3) The clinical investigation could not practicably be carried out 
without the waiver; and
    (4) Whenever appropriate, the subjects will be provided with 
additional pertinent information after participation.
    (e) In addition to the determinations required under other 
applicable sections of this subpart D, the IRB must determine, in 
accordance with and to the extent that consent is required under part 
50, that the permission of each child's parents or guardian is granted.
    (1) Where parental permission is to be obtained, the IRB may find 
that the permission of one parent is sufficient for clinical 
investigations to be conducted under Sec.  50.51 or Sec.  50.52.
    (2) Where clinical investigations are covered by Sec.  50.53 or 
Sec.  50.54 and permission is to be obtained from parents, both parents 
must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, 
incompetent, or not reasonably available, or when only one parent has 
legal responsibility for the care and custody of the child.
    (f) Permission by parents or guardians must be documented in 
accordance with and to the extent required by Sec.  50.27.
    (g) When the IRB determines that assent is required, it must also 
determine whether and how assent must be documented.

[66 FR 20598, Apr. 24, 2001, as amended at 78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  50.56  Wards.

    (a) Children who are wards of the State or any other agency, 
institution, or entity can be included in clinical investigations 
approved under Sec.  50.53 or Sec.  50.54 only if such clinical 
investigations are:
    (1) Related to their status as wards; or
    (2) Conducted in schools, camps, hospitals, institutions, or similar 
settings in which the majority of children involved as subjects are not 
wards.
    (b) If the clinical investigation is approved under paragraph (a) of 
this section, the IRB must require appointment of an advocate for each 
child who is a ward.
    (1) The advocate will serve in addition to any other individual 
acting on behalf of the child as guardian or in loco parentis.
    (2) One individual may serve as advocate for more than one child.
    (3) The advocate must be an individual who has the background and 
experience to act in, and agrees to act in, the best interest of the 
child for the duration of the child's participation in the clinical 
investigation.
    (4) The advocate must not be associated in any way (except in the 
role as advocate or member of the IRB) with the clinical investigation, 
the investigator(s), or the guardian organization.

    Source: 63 FR 5250, Feb. 2, 1998, unless otherwise noted.



Sec.  54.1  Purpose.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluates clinical 
studies submitted in marketing applications, required by law, for new 
human drugs and biological products and marketing applications and 
reclassification petitions for medical devices.
    (b) The agency reviews data generated in these clinical studies to 
determine whether the applications are approvable under the statutory 
requirements. FDA may consider clinical studies inadequate and the data 
inadequate if, among other things, appropriate steps have not been taken 
in the design, conduct, reporting, and analysis of the studies to 
minimize bias. One potential source of bias in clinical studies is a 
financial interest of the clinical investigator in the outcome of the 
study because of the way payment is arranged (e.g., a royalty) or 
because the investigator has a proprietary interest in the product 
(e.g., a patent) or because the investigator has an equity interest in 
the sponsor of the covered study. This section and conforming 
regulations require an applicant whose submission relies in part on 
clinical data to disclose certain financial arrangements between 
sponsor(s) of the covered studies and the clinical investigators and 
certain interests of the clinical investigators in the product under 
study or in the sponsor of the covered studies. FDA will use this 
information, in conjunction with information about the design and 
purpose of the study, as well as information obtained through on-site 
inspections, in the agency's assessment of the reliability of the data.



Sec.  54.2  Definitions.

    For the purposes of this part:
    (a) Compensation affected by the outcome of clinical studies means 
compensation that could be higher for a favorable outcome than for an 
unfavorable outcome, such as compensation that is explicitly greater for 
a favorable result or compensation to the investigator in the form of an 
equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study or in the form of 
compensation tied to sales of the product, such as a royalty interest.
    (b) Significant equity interest in the sponsor of a covered study 
means any ownership interest, stock options, or other financial interest 
whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public 
prices (generally, interests in a nonpublicly traded corporation), or 
any equity interest in a publicly traded corporation that exceeds 
$50,000 during the time the clinical investigator is carrying out the 
study and for 1 year following completion of the study.
    (c) Proprietary interest in the tested product means property or 
other financial interest in the product including, but not limited to, a 
patent, trademark, copyright or licensing agreement.
    (d) Clinical investigator means only a listed or identified 
investigator or subinvestigator who is directly involved in the 
treatment or evaluation of research subjects. The term also includes the 
spouse and each dependent child of the investigator.
    (e) Covered clinical study means any study of a drug or device in 
humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition 
subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish 
that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence 
to an effective product) or any study in which a single investigator 
makes a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety. This 
would, in general, not include phase l tolerance studies or 
pharmacokinetic studies, most clinical pharmacology studies (unless they 
are critical to an efficacy determination), large open safety studies 
conducted at multiple sites, treatment protocols, and parallel track 
protocols. An applicant may consult with FDA as to which clinical 
studies constitute ``covered clinical studies'' for purposes of 
complying with financial disclosure requirements.
    (f) Significant payments of other sorts means payments made by the 
sponsor of a covered study to the investigator

[[Page 354]]

or the institution to support activities of the investigator that have a 
monetary value of more than $25,000, exclusive of the costs of 
conducting the clinical study or other clinical studies, (e.g., a grant 
to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form of equipment or 
retainers for ongoing consultation or honoraria) during the time the 
clinical investigator is carrying out the study and for 1 year following 
the completion of the study.
    (g) Applicant means the party who submits a marketing application to 
FDA for approval of a drug, device, or biologic product. The applicant 
is responsible for submitting the appropriate certification and 
disclosure statements required in this part.
    (h) Sponsor of the covered clinical study means the party supporting 
a particular study at the time it was carried out.

[63 FR 5250, Feb. 2, 1998, as amended at 63 FR 72181, Dec. 31, 1998]



Sec.  54.3  Scope.

    The requirements in this part apply to any applicant who submits a 
marketing application for a human drug, biological product, or device 
and who submits covered clinical studies. The applicant is responsible 
for making the appropriate certification or disclosure statement where 
the applicant either contracted with one or more clinical investigators 
to conduct the studies or submitted studies conducted by others not 
under contract to the applicant.



Sec.  54.4  Certification and disclosure requirements.

    For purposes of this part, an applicant must submit a list of all 
clinical investigators who conducted covered clinical studies to 
determine whether the applicant's product meets FDA's marketing 
requirements, identifying those clinical investigators who are full-time 
or part-time employees of the sponsor of each covered study. The 
applicant must also completely and accurately disclose or certify 
information concerning the financial interests of a clinical 
investigator who is not a full-time or part-time employee of the sponsor 
for each covered clinical study. Clinical investigators subject to 
investigational new drug or investigational device exemption regulations 
must provide the sponsor of the study with sufficient accurate 
information needed to allow subsequent disclosure or certification. The 
applicant is required to submit for each clinical investigator who 
participates in a covered study, either a certification that none of the 
financial arrangements described in Sec.  54.2 exist, or disclose the 
nature of those arrangements to the agency. Where the applicant acts 
with due diligence to obtain the information required in this section 
but is unable to do so, the applicant shall certify that despite the 
applicant's due diligence in attempting to obtain the information, the 
applicant was unable to obtain the information and shall include the 
reason.
    (a) The applicant (of an application submitted under sections 505, 
506, 510(k), 513, or 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or 
section 351 of the Public Health Service Act) that relies in whole or in 
part on clinical studies shall submit, for each clinical investigator 
who participated in a covered clinical study, either a certification 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section or a disclosure statement 
described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
    (1) Certification: The applicant covered by this section shall 
submit for all clinical investigators (as defined in Sec.  54.2(d)), to 
whom the certification applies, a completed Form FDA 3454 attesting to 
the absence of financial interests and arrangements described in 
paragraph (a)(3) of this section. The form shall be dated and signed by 
the chief financial officer or other responsible corporate official or 
representative.
    (2) If the certification covers less than all covered clinical data 
in the application, the applicant shall include in the certification a 
list of the studies covered by this certification.
    (3) Disclosure Statement: For any clinical investigator defined in 
Sec.  54.2(d) for whom the applicant does not submit the certification 
described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the applicant shall 
submit a completed Form FDA 3455 disclosing completely and accurately 
the following:
    (i) Any financial arrangement entered into between the sponsor of 
the

[[Page 355]]

covered study and the clinical investigator involved in the conduct of a 
covered clinical trial, whereby the value of the compensation to the 
clinical investigator for conducting the study could be influenced by 
the outcome of the study;
    (ii) Any significant payments of other sorts from the sponsor of the 
covered study, such as a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in 
the form of equipment, retainer for ongoing consultation, or honoraria;
    (iii) Any proprietary interest in the tested product held by any 
clinical investigator involved in a study;
    (iv) Any significant equity interest in the sponsor of the covered 
study held by any clinical investigator involved in any clinical study; 
and
    (v) Any steps taken to minimize the potential for bias resulting 
from any of the disclosed arrangements, interests, or payments.
    (b) The clinical investigator shall provide to the sponsor of the 
covered study sufficient accurate financial information to allow the 
sponsor to submit complete and accurate certification or disclosure 
statements as required in paragraph (a) of this section. The 
investigator shall promptly update this information if any relevant 
changes occur in the course of the investigation or for 1 year following 
completion of the study.
    (c) Refusal to file application. FDA may refuse to file any 
marketing application described in paragraph (a) of this section that 
does not contain the information required by this section or a 
certification by the applicant that the applicant has acted with due 
diligence to obtain the information but was unable to do so and stating 
the reason.

[63 FR 5250, Feb. 2, 1998; 63 FR 35134, June 29, 1998, as amended at 64 
FR 399, Jan. 5, 1999]



Sec.  54.5  Agency evaluation of financial interests.

    (a) Evaluation of disclosure statement. FDA will evaluate the 
information disclosed under Sec.  54.4(a)(2) about each covered clinical 
study in an application to determine the impact of any disclosed 
financial interests on the reliability of the study. FDA may consider 
both the size and nature of a disclosed financial interest (including 
the potential increase in the value of the interest if the product is 
approved) and steps that have been taken to minimize the potential for 
bias.
    (b) Effect of study design. In assessing the potential of an 
investigator's financial interests to bias a study, FDA will take into 
account the design and purpose of the study. Study designs that utilize 
such approaches as multiple investigators (most of whom do not have a 
disclosable interest), blinding, objective endpoints, or measurement of 
endpoints by someone other than the investigator may adequately protect 
against any bias created by a disclosable financial interest.
    (c) Agency actions to ensure reliability of data. If FDA determines 
that the financial interests of any clinical investigator raise a 
serious question about the integrity of the data, FDA will take any 
action it deems necessary to ensure the reliability of the data 
including:
    (1) Initiating agency audits of the data derived from the clinical 
investigator in question;
    (2) Requesting that the applicant submit further analyses of data, 
e.g., to evaluate the effect of the clinical investigator's data on 
overall study outcome;
    (3) Requesting that the applicant conduct additional independent 
studies to confirm the results of the questioned study; and
    (4) Refusing to treat the covered clinical study as providing data 
that can be the basis for an agency action.



Sec.  54.6  Recordkeeping and record retention.

    (a) Financial records of clinical investigators to be retained. An 
applicant who has submitted a marketing application containing covered 
clinical studies shall keep on file certain information pertaining to 
the financial interests of clinical investigators who conducted studies 
on which the application relies and who are not full or part-time 
employees of the applicant, as follows:
    (1) Complete records showing any financial interest or arrangement 
as described in Sec.  54.4(a)(3)(i) paid to such clinical investigators 
by the sponsor of the covered study.

[[Page 356]]

    (2) Complete records showing significant payments of other sorts, as 
described in Sec.  54.4(a)(3)(ii), made by the sponsor of the covered 
clinical study to the clinical investigator.
    (3) Complete records showing any financial interests held by 
clinical investigators as set forth in Sec.  54.4(a)(3)(iii) and 
(a)(3)(iv).
    (b) Requirements for maintenance of clinical investigators' 
financial records. (1) For any application submitted for a covered 
product, an applicant shall retain records as described in paragraph (a) 
of this section for 2 years after the date of approval of the 
application.
    (2) The person maintaining these records shall, upon request from 
any properly authorized officer or employee of FDA, at reasonable times, 
permit such officer or employee to have access to and copy and verify 
these records.

    (21) Data and information about a clinical study of an infant 
formula when submitted as part of an infant formula notification under 
section 412(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.
    (22) Data and information submitted in a petition for a nutrient 
content claim, described in Sec.  101.69 of this chapter, and for a 
health claim, described in Sec.  101.70 of this chapter.
    (23) Data and information from investigations involving children 
submitted in a new dietary ingredient notification, described in Sec.  
190.6 of this chapter.
    (c) Clinical investigation means any experiment that involves a test 
article and one or more human subjects, and that either must meet the 
requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration 
under section

[[Page 358]]

505(i) or 520(g) of the act, or need not meet the requirements for prior 
submission to the Food and Drug Administration under these sections of 
the act, but the results of which are intended to be later submitted to, 
or held for inspection by, the Food and Drug Administration as part of 
an application for a research or marketing permit. The term does not 
include experiments that must meet the provisions of part 58, regarding 
nonclinical laboratory studies. The terms research, clinical research, 
clinical study, study, and clinical investigation are deemed to be 
synonymous for purposes of this part.
    (d) Emergency use means the use of a test article on a human subject 
in a life-threatening situation in which no standard acceptable 
treatment is available, and in which there is not sufficient time to 
obtain IRB approval.
    (e) Human subject means an individual who is or becomes a 
participant in research, either as a recipient of the test article or as 
a control. A subject may be either a healthy individual or a patient.
    (f) Institution means any public or private entity or agency 
(including Federal, State, and other agencies). The term facility as 
used in section 520(g) of the act is deemed to be synonymous with the 
term institution for purposes of this part.
    (g) Institutional Review Board (IRB) means any board, committee, or 
other group formally designated by an institution to review, to approve 
the initiation of, and to conduct periodic review of, biomedical 
research involving human subjects. The primary purpose of such review is 
to assure the protection of the rights and welfare of the human 
subjects. The term has the same meaning as the phrase institutional 
review committee as used in section 520(g) of the act.
    (h) Investigator means an individual who actually conducts a 
clinical investigation (i.e., under whose immediate direction the test 
article is administered or dispensed to, or used involving, a subject) 
or, in the event of an investigation conducted by a team of individuals, 
is the responsible leader of that team.
    (i) Minimal risk means that the probability and magnitude of harm or 
discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of 
themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the 
performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests.
    (j) Sponsor means a person or other entity that initiates a clinical 
investigation, but that does not actually conduct the investigation, 
i.e., the test article is administered or dispensed to, or used 
involving, a subject under the immediate direction of another 
individual. A person other than an individual (e.g., a corporation or 
agency) that uses one or more of its own employees to conduct an 
investigation that it has initiated is considered to be a sponsor (not a 
sponsor-investigator), and the employees are considered to be 
investigators.
    (k) Sponsor-investigator means an individual who both initiates and 
actually conducts, alone or with others, a clinical investigation, i.e., 
under whose immediate direction the test article is administered or 
dispensed to, or used involving, a subject. The term does not include 
any person other than an individual, e.g., it does not include a 
corporation or agency. The obligations of a sponsor-investigator under 
this part include both those of a sponsor and those of an investigator.
    (l) Test article means any drug for human use, biological product 
for human use, medical device for human use, human food additive, color 
additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation 
under the act or under sections 351 or 354-360F of the Public Health 
Service Act.
    (m) IRB approval means the determination of the IRB that the 
clinical investigation has been reviewed and may be conducted at an 
institution within the constraints set forth by the IRB and by other 
institutional and Federal requirements.

Sec.  56.103  Circumstances in which IRB review is required.

    (a) Except as provided in Sec. Sec.  56.104 and 56.105, any clinical 
investigation which

[[Page 359]]

must meet the requirements for prior submission (as required in parts 
312, 812, and 813) to the Food and Drug Administration shall not be 
initiated unless that investigation has been reviewed and approved by, 
and remains subject to continuing review by, an IRB meeting the 
requirements of this part.
    (b) Except as provided in Sec. Sec.  56.104 and 56.105, the Food and 
Drug Administration may decide not to consider in support of an 
application for a research or marketing permit any data or information 
that has been derived from a clinical investigation that has not been 
approved by, and that was not subject to initial and continuing review 
by, an IRB meeting the requirements of this part. The determination that 
a clinical investigation may not be considered in support of an 
application for a research or marketing permit does not, however, 
relieve the applicant for such a permit of any obligation under any 
other applicable regulations to submit the results of the investigation 
to the Food and Drug Administration.
    (c) Compliance with these regulations will in no way render 
inapplicable pertinent Federal, State, or local laws or regulations.

Sec.  56.104  Exemptions from IRB requirement.

    The following categories of clinical investigations are exempt from 
the requirements of this part for IRB review:
    (a) Any investigation which commenced before July 27, 1981 and was 
subject to requirements for IRB review under FDA regulations before that 
date, provided that the investigation remains subject to review of an 
IRB which meets the FDA requirements in effect before July 27, 1981.
    (b) Any investigation commenced before July 27, 1981 and was not 
otherwise subject to requirements for IRB review under Food and Drug 
Administration regulations before that date.
    (c) Emergency use of a test article, provided that such emergency 
use is reported to the IRB within 5 working days. Any subsequent use of 
the test article at the institution is subject to IRB review.
    (d) Taste and food quality evaluations and consumer acceptance 
studies, if wholesome foods without additives are consumed or if a food 
is consumed that contains a food ingredient at or below the level and 
for a use found to be safe, or agricultural, chemical, or environmental 
contaminant at or below the level found to be safe, by the Food and Drug 
Administration or approved by the Environmental Protection Agency or the 
Food Safety and Inspection Service of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture.

Sec.  56.105  Waiver of IRB requirement.

    On the application of a sponsor or sponsor-investigator, the Food 
and Drug Administration may waive any of the requirements contained in 
these regulations, including the requirements for IRB review, for 
specific research activities or for classes of research activities, 
otherwise covered by these regulations.



                  Subpart B_Organization and Personnel



Sec.  56.106  Registration.

    (a) Who must register? Each IRB in the United States that reviews 
clinical investigations regulated by FDA under sections 505(i) or 520(g) 
of the act and each IRB in the United States that reviews clinical 
investigations that are intended to support applications for research or 
marketing permits for FDA-regulated products must register at a site 
maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). (A 
research permit under section 505(i) of the act is usually known as an 
investigational new drug application (IND), while a research permit 
under section 520(g) of the act is usually known as an investigational 
device exemption (IDE).) An individual authorized to act on the IRB's 
behalf must submit the registration information. All other IRBs may 
register voluntarily.
    (b) What information must an IRB register? Each IRB must provide the 
following information:
    (1) The name, mailing address, and street address (if different from 
the

[[Page 360]]

mailing address) of the institution operating the IRB and the name, 
mailing address, phone number, facsimile number, and electronic mail 
address of the senior officer of that institution who is responsible for 
overseeing activities performed by the IRB;
    (2) The IRB's name, mailing address, street address (if different 
from the mailing address), phone number, facsimile number, and 
electronic mail address; each IRB chairperson's name, phone number, and 
electronic mail address; and the name, mailing address, phone number, 
facsimile number, and electronic mail address of the contact person 
providing the registration information.
    (3) The approximate number of active protocols involving FDA-
regulated products reviewed. For purposes of this rule, an ``active 
protocol'' is any protocol for which an IRB conducted an initial review 
or a continuing review at a convened meeting or under an expedited 
review procedure during the preceding 12 months; and
    (4) A description of the types of FDA-regulated products (such as 
biological products, color additives, food additives, human drugs, or 
medical devices) involved in the protocols that the IRB reviews.
    (c) When must an IRB register? Each IRB must submit an initial 
registration. The initial registration must occur before the IRB begins 
to review a clinical investigation described in paragraph (a) of this 
section. Each IRB must renew its registration every 3 years. IRB 
registration becomes effective after review and acceptance by HHS.
    (d) Where can an IRB register? Each IRB may register electronically 
through http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/efile. If an IRB lacks the ability to 
register electronically, it must send its registration information, in 
writing, to the Office of Good Clinical Practice, Office of Special 
Medical Programs, Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire 
Ave., Bldg. 32, Rm. 5129, Silver Spring, MD 20993.
    (e) How does an IRB revise its registration information? If an IRB's 
contact or chair person information changes, the IRB must revise its 
registration information by submitting any changes in that information 
within 90 days of the change. An IRB's decision to review new types of 
FDA-regulated products (such as a decision to review studies pertaining 
to food additives whereas the IRB previously reviewed studies pertaining 
to drug products), or to discontinue reviewing clinical investigations 
regulated by FDA is a change that must be reported within 30 days of the 
change. An IRB's decision to disband is a change that must be reported 
within 30 days of permanent cessation of the IRB's review of research. 
All other information changes may be reported when the IRB renews its 
registration. The revised information must be sent to FDA either 
electronically or in writing in accordance with paragraph (d) of this 
section.

[74 FR 2368, Jan. 15, 2009, as amended at 78 FR 16401, Mar. 15, 2013]



Sec.  56.107  IRB membership.

    (a) Each IRB shall have at least five members, with varying 
backgrounds to promote complete and adequate review of research 
activities commonly conducted by the institution. The IRB shall be 
sufficiently qualified through the experience and expertise of its 
members, and the diversity of the members, including consideration of 
race, gender, cultural backgrounds, and sensitivity to such issues as 
community attitudes, to promote respect for its advice and counsel in 
safeguarding the rights and welfare of human subjects. In addition to 
possessing the professional competence necessary to review the specific 
research activities, the IRB shall be able to ascertain the 
acceptability of proposed research in terms of institutional commitments 
and regulations, applicable law, and standards of professional conduct 
and practice. * * * The IRB shall therefore include persons 
knowledgeable in these areas. If an IRB regularly reviews research that 
involves a vulnerable category of subjects, such as children, prisoners, 
pregnant women, or handicapped or mentally disabled persons, 
consideration shall be given to the inclusion of one or more individuals 
who are knowledgeable about and experienced in working with those 
subjects.
    (b) Every nondiscriminatory effort will be made to ensure that no 
IRB

[[Page 361]]

consists entirely of men or entirely of women, including the 
instituton's consideration of qualified persons of both sexes, so long 
as no selection is made to the IRB on the basis of gender. No IRB may 
consist entirely of members of one profession.
    (c) Each IRB shall include at least one member whose primary 
concerns are in the scientific area and at least one member whose 
primary concerns are in nonscientific areas.
    (d) Each IRB shall include at least one member who is not otherwise 
affiliated with the institution and who is not part of the immediate 
family of a person who is affiliated with the institution.
    (e) No IRB may have a member participate in the IRB's initial or 
continuing review of any project in which the member has a conflicting 
interest, except to provide information requested by the IRB.
    (f) An IRB may, in its discretion, invite individuals with 
competence in special areas to assist in the review of complex issues 
which require expertise beyond or in addition to that available on the 
IRB. These individuals may not vote with the IRB.

                 Subpart C_IRB Functions and Operations



Sec.  56.108  IRB functions and operations.

    In order to fulfill the requirements of these regulations, each IRB 
shall:
    (a) Follow written procedures: (1) For conducting its initial and 
continuing review of research and for reporting its findings and actions 
to the investigator and the institution; (2) for determining which 
projects require review more often than annually and which projects need 
verification from sources other than the investigator that no material 
changes have occurred since previous IRB review; (3) for ensuring prompt 
reporting to the IRB of changes in research activity; and (4) for 
ensuring that changes in approved research, during the period for which 
IRB approval has already been given, may not be initiated without IRB 
review and approval except where necessary to eliminate apparent 
immediate hazards to the human subjects.
    (b) Follow written procedures for ensuring prompt reporting to the 
IRB, appropriate institutional officials, and the Food and Drug 
Administration of: (1) Any unanticipated problems involving risks to 
human subjects or others; (2) any instance of serious or continuing 
noncompliance with these regulations or the requirements or 
determinations of the IRB; or (3) any suspension or termination of IRB 
approval.
    (c) Except when an expedited review procedure is used (see Sec.  
56.110), review proposed research at convened meetings at which a 
majority of the members of the IRB are present, including at least one 
member whose primary concerns are in nonscientific areas. In order for 
the research to be approved, it shall receive the approval of a majority 
of those members present at the meeting.

[46 FR 8975, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 28028, June 18, 1991; 67 
FR 9585, Mar. 4, 2002]



Sec.  56.109  IRB review of research.

    (a) An IRB shall review and have authority to approve, require 
modifications in (to secure approval), or disapprove all research 
activities covered by these regulations.
    (b) An IRB shall require that information given to subjects as part 
of informed consent is in accordance with Sec.  50.25. The IRB may 
require that information, in addition to that specifically mentioned in 
Sec.  50.25, be given to the subjects when in the IRB's judgment the 
information would meaningfully add to the protection of the rights and 
welfare of subjects.
    (c) An IRB shall require documentation of informed consent in 
accordance with Sec.  50.27 of this chapter, except as follows:
    (1) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, waive the requirement 
that the subject, or the subject's legally authorized representative, 
sign a written consent form if it finds that the research presents no 
more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures 
for which written consent is normally required outside the research 
context; or

[[Page 362]]

    (2) The IRB may, for some or all subjects, find that the 
requirements in Sec.  50.24 of this chapter for an exception from 
informed consent for emergency research are met.
    (d) In cases where the documentation requirement is waived under 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the IRB may require the investigator 
to provide subjects with a written statement regarding the research.
    (e) An IRB shall notify investigators and the institution in writing 
of its decision to approve or disapprove the proposed research activity, 
or of modifications required to secure IRB approval of the research 
activity. If the IRB decides to disapprove a research activity, it shall 
include in its written notification a statement of the reasons for its 
decision and give the investigator an opportunity to respond in person 
or in writing. For investigations involving an exception to informed 
consent under Sec.  50.24 of this chapter, an IRB shall promptly notify 
in writing the investigator and the sponsor of the research when an IRB 
determines that it cannot approve the research because it does not meet 
the criteria in the exception provided under Sec.  50.24(a) of this 
chapter or because of other relevant ethical concerns. The written 
notification shall include a statement of the reasons for the IRB's 
determination.
    (f) An IRB shall conduct continuing review of research covered by 
these regulations at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk, but 
not less than once per year, and shall have authority to observe or have 
a third party observe the consent process and the research.
    (g) An IRB shall provide in writing to the sponsor of research 
involving an exception to informed consent under Sec.  50.24 of this 
chapter a copy of information that has been publicly disclosed under 
Sec.  50.24(a)(7)(ii) and (a)(7)(iii) of this chapter. The IRB shall 
provide this information to the sponsor promptly so that the sponsor is 
aware that such disclosure has occurred. Upon receipt, the sponsor shall 
provide copies of the information disclosed to FDA.
    (h) When some or all of the subjects in a study are children, an IRB 
must determine that the research study is in compliance with part 50, 
subpart D of this chapter, at the time of its initial review of the 
research. When some or all of the subjects in a study that was ongoing 
on April 30, 2001, are children, an IRB must conduct a review of the 
research to determine compliance with part 50, subpart D of this 
chapter, either at the time of continuing review or, at the discretion 
of the IRB, at an earlier date.

[46 FR 8975, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 61 FR 51529, Oct. 2, 1996; 66 
FR 20599, Apr. 24, 2001; 78 FR 12951, Feb. 26, 2013]



Sec.  56.110  Expedited review procedures for certain kinds of
research involving no more than minimal risk, and for minor changes
in approved research.

    (a) The Food and Drug Administration has established, and published 
in the Federal Register, a list of categories of research that may be 
reviewed by the IRB through an expedited review procedure. The list will 
be amended, as appropriate, through periodic republication in the 
Federal Register.
    (b) An IRB may use the expedited review procedure to review either 
or both of the following: (1) Some or all of the research appearing on 
the list and found by the reviewer(s) to involve no more than minimal 
risk, (2) minor changes in previously approved research during the 
period (of 1 year or less) for which approval is authorized. Under an 
expedited review procedure, the review may be carried out by the IRB 
chairperson or by one or more experienced reviewers designated by the 
IRB chairperson from among the members of the IRB. In reviewing the 
research, the reviewers may exercise all of the authorities of the IRB 
except that the reviewers may not disapprove the research. A research 
activity may be disapproved only after review in accordance with the 
nonexpedited review procedure set forth in Sec.  56.108(c).
    (c) Each IRB which uses an expedited review procedure shall adopt a 
method for keeping all members advised of research proposals which have 
been approved under the procedure.
    (d) The Food and Drug Administration may restrict, suspend, or 
terminate an institution's or IRB's use of

[[Page 363]]

the expedited review procedure when necessary to protect the rights or 
welfare of subjects.

[46 FR 8975, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 28029, June 18, 1991]



Sec.  56.111  Criteria for IRB approval of research.

    (a) In order to approve research covered by these regulations the 
IRB shall determine that all of the following requirements are 
satisfied:
    (1) Risks to subjects are minimized: (i) By using procedures which 
are consistent with sound research design and which do not unnecessarily 
expose subjects to risk, and (ii) whenever appropriate, by using 
procedures already being performed on the subjects for diagnostic or 
treatment purposes.
    (2) Risks to subjects are reasonable in relation to anticipated 
benefits, if any, to subjects, and the importance of the knowledge that 
may be expected to result. In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB 
should consider only those risks and benefits that may result from the 
research (as distinguished from risks and benefits of therapies that 
subjects would receive even if not participating in the research). The 
IRB should not consider possible long-range effects of applying 
knowledge gained in the research (for example, the possible effects of 
the research on public policy) as among those research risks that fall 
within the purview of its responsibility.
    (3) Selection of subjects is equitable. In making this assessment 
the IRB should take into account the purposes of the research and the 
setting in which the research will be conducted and should be 
particularly cognizant of the special problems of research involving 
vulnerable populations, such as children, prisoners, pregnant women, 
handicapped, or mentally disabled persons, or economically or 
educationally disadvantaged persons.
    (4) Informed consent will be sought from each prospective subject or 
the subject's legally authorized representative, in accordance with and 
to the extent required by part 50.
    (5) Informed consent will be appropriately documented, in accordance 
with and to the extent required by Sec.  50.27.
    (6) Where appropriate, the research plan makes adequate provision 
for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of subjects.
    (7) Where appropriate, there are adequate provisions to protect the 
privacy of subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of data.
    (b) When some or all of the subjects, such as children, prisoners, 
pregnant women, handicapped, or mentally disabled persons, or 
economically or educationally disadvantaged persons, are likely to be 
vulnerable to coercion or undue influence additional safeguards have 
been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of these 
subjects.
    (c) In order to approve research in which some or all of the 
subjects are children, an IRB must determine that all research is in 
compliance with part 50, subpart D of this chapter.

[46 FR 8975, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 28029, June 18, 1991; 66 
FR 20599, Apr. 24, 2001]



Sec.  56.112  Review by institution.

    Research covered by these regulations that has been approved by an 
IRB may be subject to further appropriate review and approval or 
disapproval by officials of the institution. However, those officials 
may not approve the research if it has not been approved by an IRB.



Sec.  56.113  Suspension or termination of IRB approval of research.

    An IRB shall have authority to suspend or terminate approval of 
research that is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's 
requirements or that has been associated with unexpected serious harm to 
subjects. Any suspension or termination of approval shall include a 
statement of the reasons for the IRB's action and shall be reported 
promptly to the investigator, appropriate institutional officials, and 
the Food and Drug Administration.



Sec.  56.114  Cooperative research.

    In complying with these regulations, institutions involved in multi-
institutional studies may use joint review, reliance upon the review of 
another qualified IRB, or similar arrangements

[[Page 364]]

aimed at avoidance of duplication of effort.



                      Subpart D_Records and Reports



Sec.  56.115  IRB records.

    (a) An institution, or where appropriate an IRB, shall prepare and 
maintain adequate documentation of IRB activities, including the 
following:
    (1) Copies of all research proposals reviewed, scientific 
evaluations, if any, that accompany the proposals, approved sample 
consent documents, progress reports submitted by investigators, and 
reports of injuries to subjects.
    (2) Minutes of IRB meetings which shall be in sufficient detail to 
show attendance at the meetings; actions taken by the IRB; the vote on 
these actions including the number of members voting for, against, and 
abstaining; the basis for requiring changes in or disapproving research; 
and a written summary of the discussion of controverted issues and their 
resolution.
    (3) Records of continuing review activities.
    (4) Copies of all correspondence between the IRB and the 
investigators.
    (5) A list of IRB members identified by name; earned degrees; 
representative capacity; indications of experience such as board 
certifications, licenses, etc., sufficient to describe each member's 
chief anticipated contributions to IRB deliberations; and any employment 
or other relationship between each member and the institution; for 
example: full-time employee, part-time employee, a member of governing 
panel or board, stockholder, paid or unpaid consultant.
    (6) Written procedures for the IRB as required by Sec.  56.108 (a) 
and (b).
    (7) Statements of significant new findings provided to subjects, as 
required by Sec.  50.25.
    (b) The records required by this regulation shall be retained for at 
least 3 years after completion of the research, and the records shall be 
accessible for inspection and copying by authorized representatives of 
the Food and Drug Administration at reasonable times and in a reasonable 
manner.
    (c) The Food and Drug Administration may refuse to consider a 
clinical investigation in support of an application for a research or 
marketing permit if the institution or the IRB that reviewed the 
investigation refuses to allow an inspection under this section.

[46 FR 8975, Jan. 27, 1981, as amended at 56 FR 28029, June 18, 1991; 67 
FR 9585, Mar. 4, 2002]



           Subpart E_Administrative Actions for Noncompliance



Sec.  56.120  Lesser administrative actions.

    (a) If apparent noncompliance with these regulations in the 
operation of an IRB is observed by an FDA investigator during an 
inspection, the inspector will present an oral or written summary of 
observations to an appropriate representative of the IRB. The Food and 
Drug Administration may subsequently send a letter describing the 
noncompliance to the IRB and to the parent institution. The agency will 
require that the IRB or the parent institution respond to this letter 
within a time period specified by FDA and describe the corrective 
actions that will be taken by the IRB, the institution, or both to 
achieve compliance with these regulations.
    (b) On the basis of the IRB's or the institution's response, FDA may 
schedule a reinspection to confirm the adequacy of corrective actions. 
In addition, until the IRB or the parent institution takes appropriate 
corrective action, the agency may:
    (1) Withhold approval of new studies subject to the requirements of 
this part that are conducted at the institution or reviewed by the IRB;
    (2) Direct that no new subjects be added to ongoing studies subject 
to this part;
    (3) Terminate ongoing studies subject to this part when doing so 
would not endanger the subjects; or
    (4) When the apparent noncompliance creates a significant threat to 
the rights and welfare of human subjects, notify relevant State and 
Federal regulatory agencies and other parties with a direct interest in 
the agency's action of the deficiencies in the operation of the IRB.
    (c) The parent institution is presumed to be responsible for the 
operation of an IRB, and the Food and Drug

[[Page 365]]

Administration will ordinarily direct any administrative action under 
this subpart against the institution. However, depending on the evidence 
of responsibility for deficiencies, determined during the investigation, 
the Food and Drug Administration may restrict its administrative actions 
to the IRB or to a component of the parent institution determined to be 
responsible for formal designation of the IRB.



Sec.  56.121  Disqualification of an IRB or an institution.

    (a) Whenever the IRB or the institution has failed to take adequate 
steps to correct the noncompliance stated in the letter sent by the 
agency under Sec.  56.120(a), and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
determines that this noncompliance may justify the disqualification of 
the IRB or of the parent institution, the Commissioner will institute 
proceedings in accordance with the requirements for a regulatory hearing 
set forth in part 16.
    (b) The Commissioner may disqualify an IRB or the parent institution 
if the Commissioner determines that:
    (1) The IRB has refused or repeatedly failed to comply with any of 
the regulations set forth in this part, and
    (2) The noncompliance adversely affects the rights or welfare of the 
human subjects in a clinical investigation.
    (c) If the Commissioner determines that disqualification is 
appropriate, the Commissioner will issue an order that explains the 
basis for the determination and that prescribes any actions to be taken 
with regard to ongoing clinical research conducted under the review of 
the IRB. The Food and Drug Administration will send notice of the 
disqualification to the IRB and the parent institution. Other parties 
with a direct interest, such as sponsors and clinical investigators, may 
also be sent a notice of the disqualification. In addition, the agency 
may elect to publish a notice of its action in the Federal Register.
    (d) The Food and Drug Administration will not approve an application 
for a research permit for a clinical investigation that is to be under 
the review of a disqualified IRB or that is to be conducted at a 
disqualified institution, and it may refuse to consider in support of a 
marketing permit the data from a clinical investigation that was 
reviewed by a disqualified IRB as conducted at a disqualified 
institution, unless the IRB or the parent institution is reinstated as 
provided in Sec.  56.123.



Sec.  56.122  Public disclosure of information regarding revocation.

    A determination that the Food and Drug Administration has 
disqualified an institution and the administrative record regarding that 
determination are disclosable to the public under part 20.



Sec.  56.123  Reinstatement of an IRB or an institution.

    An IRB or an institution may be reinstated if the Commissioner 
determines, upon an evaluation of a written submission from the IRB or 
institution that explains the corrective action that the institution or 
IRB plans to take, that the IRB or institution has provided adequate 
assurance that it will operate in compliance with the standards set 
forth in this part. Notification of reinstatement shall be provided to 
all persons notified under Sec.  56.121(c).



Sec.  56.124  Actions alternative or additional to disqualification.

    Disqualification of an IRB or of an institution is independent of, 
and neither in lieu of nor a precondition to, other proceedings or 
actions authorized by the act. The Food and Drug Administration may, at 
any time, through the Department of Justice institute any appropriate 
judicial proceedings (civil or criminal) and any other appropriate 
regulatory action, in addition to or in lieu of, and before, at the time 
of, or after, disqualification. The agency may also refer pertinent 
matters to another Federal, State, or local government agency for any 
action that that agency determines to be appropriate.

animal-housing unit shall appear on the outside of that unit.
    (e) Animals of different species shall be housed in separate rooms 
when necessary. Animals of the same species, but used in different 
studies, should not ordinarily be housed in the same room when 
inadvertent exposure to control or test articles or animal mixup could 
affect the outcome of either study. If such mixed housing is necessary, 
adequate differentiation by space and identification shall be made.
    (f) Animal cages, racks and accessory equipment shall be cleaned and 
sanitized at appropriate intervals.
    (g) Feed and water used for the animals shall be analyzed 
periodically to ensure that contaminants known to be capable of

Sec.  58.195  Retention of records.

    (a) Record retention requirements set forth in this section do not 
supersede the record retention requirements of any other regulations in 
this chapter.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, 
documentation records, raw data and specimens pertaining to a 
nonclinical laboratory study and required to be made by this part shall 
be retained in the archive(s) for whichever of the following periods is 
shortest:
    (1) A period of at least 2 years following the date on which an 
application for a research or marketing permit, in support of which the 
results of the nonclinical laboratory study were submitted, is approved 
by the Food and Drug Administration. This requirement does not apply to 
studies supporting investigational new drug applications (IND's) or 
applications for investigational device exemptions (IDE's), records of 
which shall be governed by the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this 
section.
    (2) A period of at least 5 years following the date on which the 
results of the nonclinical laboratory study are submitted to the Food 
and Drug Administration in support of an application for a research or 
marketing permit.
    (3) In other situations (e.g., where the nonclinical laboratory 
study does not result in the submission of the study in support of an 
application for a research or marketing permit), a period of at least 2 
years following the date on which the study is completed, terminated, or 
discontinued.
    (c) Wet specimens (except those specimens obtained from mutagenicity 
tests and wet specimens of blood, urine, feces, and biological fluids), 
samples of test or control articles, and specially prepared material, 
which are relatively fragile and differ markedly in stability and 
quality during storage, shall be retained only as long as the quality of 
the preparation affords evaluation. In no case shall retention be 
required for longer periods than those set forth in paragraphs (a) and 
(b) of this section.
    (d) The master schedule sheet, copies of protocols, and records of 
quality assurance inspections, as required by Sec.  58.35(c) shall be

            Subpart K_Disqualification of Testing Facilities



Sec.  58.200  Purpose.

    (a) The purposes of disqualification are:
    (1) To permit the exclusion from consideration of completed studies 
that were conducted by a testing facility which has failed to comply 
with the requirements of the good laboratory practice regulations until 
it can be adequately demonstrated that such noncompliance did not occur 
during, or did not affect the validity or acceptability of data 
generated by, a particular study; and
    (2) To exclude from consideration all studies completed after the 
date of disqualification until the facility can satisfy the Commissioner 
that it will conduct studies in compliance with such regulations.
    (b) The determination that a nonclinical laboratory study may not be 
considered in support of an application for a research or marketing 
permit does not, however, relieve the applicant for such a permit of any 
obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the results 
of the study to the Food and Drug Administration.



Sec.  58.202  Grounds for disqualification.

    The Commissioner may disqualify a testing facility upon finding all 
of the following:
    (a) The testing facility failed to comply with one or more of the 
regulations set forth in this part (or any other regulations regarding 
such facilities in this chapter);
    (b) The noncompliance adversely affected the validity of the 
nonclinical laboratory studies; and
    (c) Other lesser regulatory actions (e.g., warnings or rejection of 
individual studies) have not been or will probably not be adequate to 
achieve compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations.



Sec.  58.204  Notice of and opportunity for hearing on proposed 
disqualification.

    (a) Whenever the Commissioner has information indicating that 
grounds exist under Sec.  58.202 which in his opinion justify 
disqualification of a testing facility, he may issue to the testing 
facility a written notice proposing that the facility be disqualified.
    (b) A hearing on the disqualification shall be conducted in 
accordance with the requirements for a regulatory hearing set forth in 
part 16 of this chapter.



Sec.  58.206  Final order on disqualification.

    (a) If the Commissioner, after the regulatory hearing, or after the 
time for requesting a hearing expires without a request being made, upon 
an evaulation of the administrative record of the disqualification 
proceeding, makes the findings required in Sec.  58.202, he shall issue 
a final order disqualifying the facility. Such order shall include a 
statement of the basis for that determination. Upon issuing a final 
order, the Commissioner shall notify (with a copy of the order) the 
testing facility of the action.
    (b) If the Commissioner, after a regulatory hearing or after the 
time for requesting a hearing expires without a request being made, upon 
an evaluation of the administrative record of the disqualification 
proceeding, does not make the findings required in Sec.  58.202, he 
shall issue a final order terminating the disqualification proceeding. 
Such order shall include a statement of the basis for that 
determination. Upon issuing a final order the Commissioner

[[Page 378]]

shall notify the testing facility and provide a copy of the order.



Sec.  58.210  Actions upon disqualification.

    (a) Once a testing facility has been disqualified, each application 
for a research or marketing permit, whether approved or not, containing 
or relying upon any nonclinical laboratory study conducted by the 
disqualified testing facility may be examined to determine whether such 
study was or would be essential to a decision. If it is determined that 
a study was or would be essential, the Food and Drug Administration 
shall also determine whether the study is acceptable, notwithstanding 
the disqualification of the facility. Any study done by a testing 
facility before or after disqualification may be presumed to be 
unacceptable, and the person relying on the study may be required to 
establish that the study was not affected by the circumstances that led 
to the disqualification, e.g., by submitting validating information. If 
the study is then determined to be unacceptable, such data will be 
eliminated from consideration in support of the application; and such 
elimination may serve as new information justifying the termination or 
withdrawal of approval of the application.
    (b) No nonclinical laboratory study begun by a testing facility 
after the date of the facility's disqualification shall be considered in 
support of any application for a research or marketing permit, unless 
the facility has been reinstated under Sec.  58.219. The determination 
that a study may not be considered in support of an application for a 
research or marketing permit does not, however, relieve the applicant 
for such a permit of any obligation under any other applicable 
regulation to submit the results of the study to the Food and Drug 
Administration.

[43 FR 60013, Dec. 22, 1978, as amended at 59 FR 13200, Mar. 21, 1994]



Sec.  58.213  Public disclosure of information regarding disqualification.

    (a) Upon issuance of a final order disqualifying a testing facility 
under Sec.  58.206(a), the Commissioner may notify all or any interested 
persons. Such notice may be given at the discretion of the Commissioner 
whenever he believes that such disclosure would further the public 
interest or would promote compliance with the good laboratory practice 
regulations set forth in this part. Such notice, if given, shall include 
a copy of the final order issued under Sec.  58.206(a) and shall state 
that the disqualification constitutes a determination by the Food and 
Drug Administration that nonclinical laboratory studies performed by the 
facility will not be considered by the Food and Drug Administration in 
support of any application for a research or marketing permit. If such 
notice is sent to another Federal Government agency, the Food and Drug 
Administration will recommend that the agency also consider whether or 
not it should accept nonclinical laboratory studies performed by the 
testing facility. If such notice is sent to any other person, it shall 
state that it is given because of the relationship between the testing 
facility and the person being notified and that the Food and Drug 
Administration is not advising or recommending that any action be taken 
by the person notified.
    (b) A determination that a testing facility has been disqualified 
and the administrative record regarding such determination are 
disclosable to the public under part 20 of this chapter.



Sec.  58.215  Alternative or additional actions to disqualification.

    (a) Disqualification of a testing facility under this subpart is 
independent of, and neither in lieu of nor a precondition to, other 
proceedings or actions authorized by the act. The Food and Drug 
Administration may, at any time, institute against a testing facility 
and/or against the sponsor of a nonclinical laboratory study that has 
been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration any appropriate 
judicial proceedings (civil or criminal) and any other appropriate 
regulatory action, in addition to or in lieu of, and prior to, 
simultaneously with, or subsequent to, disqualification. The Food and 
Drug Administration may also refer the matter to another Federal, State, 
or local government law enforcement or regulatory agency for such action 
as that agency deems appropriate.

[[Page 379]]

    (b) The Food and Drug Administration may refuse to consider any 
particular nonclinical laboratory study in support of an application for 
a research or marketing permit, if it finds that the study was not 
conducted in accordance with the good laboratory practice regulations 
set forth in this part, without disqualifying the testing facility that 
conducted the study or undertaking other regulatory action.



Sec.  58.217  Suspension or termination of a testing facility by
a sponsor.

    Termination of a testing facility by a sponsor is independent of, 
and neither in lieu of nor a precondition to, proceedings or actions 
authorized by this subpart. If a sponsor terminates or suspends a 
testing facility from further participation in a nonclinical laboratory 
study that is being conducted as part of any application for a research 
or marketing permit that has been submitted to any Center of the Food 
and Drug Administration (whether approved or not), it shall notify that 
Center in writing within 15 working days of the action; the notice shall 
include a statement of the reasons for such action. Suspension or 
termination of a testing facility by a sponsor does not relieve it of 
any obligation under any other applicable regulation to submit the 
results of the study to the Food and Drug Administration.

[43 FR 60013, Dec. 22, 1978, as amended at 50 FR 8995, Mar. 6, 1985]



Sec.  58.219  Reinstatement of a disqualified testing facility.

    A testing facility that has been disqualified may be reinstated as 
an acceptable source of nonclinical laboratory studies to be submitted 
to the Food and Drug Administration if the Commissioner determines, upon 
an evaluation of the submission of the testing facility, that the 
facility can adequately assure that it will conduct future nonclinical 
laboratory studies in compliance with the good laboratory practice 
regulations set forth in this part and, if any studies are currently 
being conducted, that the quality and integrity of such studies have not 
been seriously compromised. A disqualified testing facility that wishes 
to be so reinstated shall present in writing to the Commissioner reasons 
why it believes it should be reinstated and a detailed description of 
the corrective actions it has taken or intends to take to assure that 
the acts or omissions which led to its disqualification will not recur. 
The Commissioner may condition reinstatement upon the testing facility 
being found in compliance with the good laboratory practice regulations 
upon an inspection. If a testing facility is reinstated, the 
Commissioner shall so notify the testing facility and all organizations 
and persons who were notified, under Sec.  58.213 of the 
disqualification of the testing facility. A determination that a testing 
facility has been reinstated is disclosable to the public under part 20 
of this chapter.

sought;
    (4) The approved indications or uses for the product;
    (5) An explanation of any discrepancies between the dates in the 
application and FDA records;
    (6) Where appropriate, an explanation that FDA has no record in 
which to review the date(s) contained in the application; and
    (7) The regulatory review period determination, including a 
statement of the length of the testing and approval phases and the dates 
used in calculating each phase.

[53 FR 7305, Mar. 7, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 14364, Mar. 28, 1994]



Sec.  60.22  Regulatory review period determinations.

    In determining a product's regulatory review period, which consists 
of the sum of the lengths of a testing phase and an approval phase, FDA 
will review the information in each application using the following 
definitions of the testing phase and the approval phase for that class 
of products.
    (a) For human drugs:
    (1) The testing phase begins on the date an exemption under section 
505(i) of the Act becomes effective (or the date an exemption under 
former section 507(d) of the Act became effective) for the approved 
human drug product and ends on the date a marketing application under 
section 351 of the Public Health Service Act or section 505 of the act 
is initially submitted to FDA (or was initially submitted to FDA under 
former section 507 of the Act), and
    (2) The approval phase begins on the date a marketing application 
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act or section 505(b) of 
the Act is initially submitted to FDA (or was initially submitted under 
former section 507 of the Act) and ends on the date the application is 
approved.

[[Page 383]]

    (b) For food and color additives:
    (1) The testing phase begins on the date a major health or 
environmental effects test is begun and ends on the date a petition 
relying on the test and requesting the issuance of a regulation for use 
of the additive under section 409 or 721 of the Act is initially 
submitted to FDA.
    (2) The approval phase begins on the date a petition requesting the 
issuance of a regulation for use of the additive under section 409 or 
721 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA and ends upon whichever of 
the following occurs last:
    (i) The regulation for the additive becomes effective; or
    (ii) Objections filed against the regulation that result in a stay 
of effectiveness are resolved and commercial marketing is permitted; or
    (iii) Proceedings resulting from objections to the regulation, after 
commercial marketing has been permitted and later stayed pending 
resolution of the proceedings, are finally resolved and commercial 
marketing is permitted.
    (c) For medical devices:
    (1) The testing phase begins on the date a clinical investigation on 
humans is begun and ends on the date an application for premarket 
approval of the device or a notice of completion of a product 
development protocol is initially submitted under section 515 of the 
Act. For purposes of this part, a clinical investigation is considered 
to begin on whichever of the following dates applies:
    (i) If an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 
520(g) of the Act is required, the effective date of the exemption.
    (ii) If an IDE is not required, but institutional review board (IRB) 
approval under section 520(g)(3) of the Act is required, the IRB 
approval date.
    (iii) If neither an IDE nor IRB approval is required, the date on 
which the device is first used with human subjects as part of a clinical 
investigation to be filed with FDA to secure premarket approval of the 
device.
    (2) The approval phase either:
    (i) Begins on the date an application for premarket approval of the 
device is initially submitted under section 515 of the Act and ends on 
the date the application is approved; or
    (ii) Begins on the date a notice of completion of a product 
development protocol is initially submitted under section 515 of the Act 
and ends on the date the protocol is declared to be completed.
    (d) For animal drugs:
    (1) The testing phase begins on the date a major health or 
environmental effects test is begun or the date on which the agency 
acknowledges the filing of a notice of claimed investigational exemption 
for a new animal drug, whichever is earlier, and ends on the date a 
marketing application under section 512 of the Act is initially 
submitted to FDA.
    (2) The approval phase begins on the date a marketing application 
under section 512 of the Act is initially submitted to FDA and ends on 
the date the application is approved.
    (e) For purposes of this section, a ``major health or environmental 
effects test'' may be any test which:
    (1) Is reasonably related to the evaluation of the product's health 
or environmental effects, or both:
    (2) Produces data necessary for marketing approval; and
    (3) Is conducted over a period of no less than 6 months duration, 
excluding time required to analyze or evaluate test results.
    (f) For purposes of determining the regulatory review period for any 
product, a marketing application, a notice of completion of a product 
development protocol, or a petition is initially submitted on the date 
it contains sufficient information to allow FDA to commence review of 
the application. A marketing application, a notice of completion of a 
product development protocol, or a petition is approved on the date FDA 
sends the applicant a letter informing it of the approval or, by order 
declares a product development protocol to be completed, or, in the case 
of food and color additives, on the effective date of the final rule 
listing the additive for use as published in the Federal Register or, in 
the case of a new animal drug in a Category II Type A medicated article, 
on the date of publication in the Federal Register of the notice of 
approval pursuant to

[[Page 384]]

section 512(i) of the Act. For purposes of this section, the regulatory 
review period for an animal drug shall mean either the regulatory review 
period relating the drug's approval for use in nonfood-producing animals 
or the regulatory review period relating to the drug's approval for use 
in food-producing animals, whichever is applicable.

[53 FR 7305, Mar. 7, 1988, as amended at 57 FR 56262, Nov. 27, 1992; 64 
FR 400, Jan. 5, 1999]



Sec.  60.24  Revision of regulatory review period determinations.

    (a) Any person may request a revision of the regulatory review 
period determination within 60 days after its initial publication in the 
Federal Register. The request shall be sent to the Division of Dockets 
Management (HFA-305), Food and Drug Administration, 5630 Fishers Lane, 
rm. 1061, Rockville, MD 20852. The request shall specify the following:
    (1) The type of action requested;
    (2) The identity of the product;

applicant shall respond to the request within 15 days. In responding to 
the request, the applicant may submit information which is relevant to 
the events during the regulatory review period but which was not 
included in the original patent term restoration application. A request 
for a revision is not equivalent to a due diligence petition under Sec.  
60.30 or a request for a hearing under Sec.  60.40. If no response is 
submitted, FDA will decide the matter on the basis of the information in 
the patent term restoration application, request for revision, and FDA 
records.
    (c) FDA shall apply the provisions of Sec.  60.22 in considering the 
request for a revision of the regulatory review period determination. lf 
FDA revises its prior determination, FDA will notify PTO of the 
revision, send a copy of this notification to the applicant, and publish 
the revision in the Federal Register, including a statement giving the 
reasons for the revision.

[53 FR 7305, Mar. 7, 1988, as amended at 59 FR 14364, Mar. 28, 1994; 67

Sec.  60.26  Final action on regulatory review period determinations.

    (a) FDA will consider a regulatory review period determination to be 
final upon expiration of the 180-day period for filing a due diligence 
petition under Sec.  60.30 unless FDA receives:
    (1) New information from PTO records, FDA records, or FDA centers 
that affects the regulatory review period determination;
    (2) A request under Sec.  60.24 for revision of the regulatory 
review period determination;
    (3) A due diligence petition filed under Sec.  60.30; or
    (4) A request for a hearing filed under Sec.  60.40.
    (b) FDA will notify PTO that the regulatory review period 
determination is final upon:
    (1) The expiration of the 180-day period for filing a due diligence 
petition; or
    (2) If FDA has received a request for a revision, a due diligence 
petition, or a request for a hearing, upon resolution of the request for 
a revision, the petition, or the hearing, whichever is later. FDA will 
send a copy of the notification to the applicant and file a copy of the 
notification in the docket established for the application in FDA's 
Division of Dockets Management (HFA-305), 5630 Fishers Lane, rm. 1061, 
Rockville, MD 20852.

    (3) The petition does not contain the information required by Sec.  
10.30;
    (4) The petition fails to contain information or allegations upon 
which it may reasonably be determined that the applicant did not act 
with due diligence during the applicable regulatory review period; or
    (5) The petition fails to allege a sufficient total amount of time 
during which the applicant did not exercise due diligence such that, 
even if the petition were granted, the petition would

[[Page 386]]

not affect the maximum patent extension the applicant sought in the 
application.



Sec.  60.36  Standard of due diligence.

    (a) In determining the due diligence of an applicant, FDA will 
examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant's actions during 
the regulatory review period to determine whether the applicant 
exhibited that degree of attention, continuous directed effort, and 
timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and are ordinarily 
exercised by, a person during a regulatory review period. FDA will take 
into consideration all relevant factors, such as the amount of time 
between the approval of an investigational exemption or research permit 
and the commencement of a clinical investigation and the amount of time 
required to conduct a clinical investigation.
    (b) For purposes of this part, the actions of the marketing 
applicant shall be imputed to the applicant for patent term restoration. 
The actions of an agent, attorney, contractor, employee, licensee, or 
predecessor in interest of the marketing applicant or applicant for 
patent term restoration shall be imputed to the applicant for patent 
term restoration.



                    Subpart E_Due Diligence Hearings

                      Subpart A_General Provisions



Sec.  70.3  Definitions.

    (a) Secretary means the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
    (b) Department means the Department of Health and Human Services.
    (c) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Food and Drugs.
    (d) Act means the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended.
    (e) Color Certification Branch means the unit established within the 
Food and Drug Administration located in the Center for Food Safety and 
Applied Nutrition, charged with the responsibility for the mechanics of 
the certification procedure hereinafter described, and including the 
examination of samples of color additives subject to certification.
    (f) A color additive is any material, not exempted under section 
201(t) of the act, that is a dye, pigment, or other substance made by a 
process of synthesis or similar artifice, or extracted, isolated, or 
otherwise derived, with or without intermediate or final change of 
identity, from a vegetable, animal, mineral, or other source and that, 
when added or applied to a food, drug, or cosmetic or to the human body 
or any part thereof, is capable (alone or through reaction with another 
substance) of imparting a color thereto. Substances capable of imparting 
a color to a container for foods, drugs, or cosmetics are not color 
additives unless the customary or reasonably foreseeable handling or use 
of the container may reasonably be expected to result in the transmittal 
of the color to the contents of the package or any part thereof. Food 
ingredients such as cherries, green or red peppers, chocolate, and 
orange juice which contribute their own natural color when mixed with 
other foods are not regarded as color additives; but where a food 
substance such as beet juice is deliberately used as a color, as in pink 
lemonade, it is a color additive. Food ingredients as authorized by a 
definitions and standard of identity prescribed by regulations pursuant 
to section 401 of the act are color additives, where the ingredients are 
specifically designated in the definitions and standards of identity as 
permitted for use for coloring purposes. An ingredient of an animal feed 
whose intended function is to impart, through the biological processes 
of the animal, a color to the meat, milk, or eggs of the animal is a 
color additive and is not exempt from the requirements of the statute. 
This definition shall apply whether or not such ingredient has nutritive 
or other functions in addition to the property of imparting color. An 
ingested drug the intended function of which is to impart color to the 
human body is a color additive. For the purposes of this part, the term 
color includes black, white, and intermediate grays, but substances 
including migrants from packaging materials which do not contribute any 
color apparent to the naked eye are not color additives.
    (g) For a material otherwise meeting the definition of color 
additive to be exempt from section 721 of the act, on the basis that it 
is used (or intended to be used) solely for a purpose or purposes other 
than coloring, the material must be used in a way that any color 
imparted is clearly unimportant insofar as the appearance, value, 
marketability, or consumer acceptability is concerned. (It is not enough 
to warrant exemption if conditions are such that the primary purpose of 
the material is other than to impart color.)
    (h) The exemption that applies to a pesticide chemical, soil or 
plant nutrient, or other agricultural chemical, where its coloring 
effect results solely

[[Page 388]]

from its aiding, retarding, or otherwise affecting directly or 
indirectly, the growth or other natural physiological processes of 
produce of the soil, applies only to color developed in such product 
through natural physiological processes such as enzymatic action. If the 
pesticide chemical, soil or plant nutrient, or other agricultural 
chemical itself acts as a color or carries as an ingredient a color, and 
because of this property colors the produce of the soil, it is a color 
additive and is not exempt.
    (i) Safe means that there is convincing evidence that establishes 
with reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the intended use 
of the color additive.
    (j) The term straight color means a color additive listed in parts 
73, 74, and 81 of this chapter, and includes lakes and such substances 
as are permitted by the specifications for such color.
    (k) The term mixture means a color additive made by mixing two or 
more straight colors, or one or more straight colors and one or more 
diluents.
    (l) The term lake means a straight color extended on a substratum by 
adsorption, coprecipitation, or chemical combination that does not 
include any combination of ingredients made by simple mixing process.
    (m) The term diluent means any component of a color additive mixture 
that is not of itself a color additive and has been intentionally mixed 
therein to facilitate the use of the mixture in coloring foods, drugs, 
or cosmetics or in coloring the human body. The diluent may serve 
another functional purpose in the foods, drugs, or cosmetics, as for 
example sweetening, flavoring, emulsifying, or stabilizing, or may be a 
functional component of an article intended for coloring the human body.
    (n) The term substratum means the substance on which the pure color 
in a lake is extended.
    (o) The term pure color means the color contained in a color 
additive, exclusive of any intermediate or other component, or of any 
diluent or substratum contained therein.
    (p) The term batch means a homogeneous lot of color additive or 
color additive mixture produced by an identified production operation, 
which is set apart and held as a unit for the purpose of obtaining 
certification of such quantity.
    (q) The term batch number means the number assigned to a batch by 
the person who requests certification thereof.
    (r) The term lot number means an identifying number or symbol 
assigned to a batch by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (s) The term area of the eye means the area enclosed with in the 
circumference of the supra-orbital ridge and the infra-orbital ridge, 
including the eyebrow, the skin below the eyebrow, the eyelids and the 
eyelashes, and conjunctival sac of the eye, the eyeball, and the soft 
areolar tissue that lies within the perimeter of the infra-orbital 
ridge.
    (t) The term package means the immediate container in which a color 
additive or color additive mixture has been packed for shipment or 
delivery. If the package is then packed in a shipping carton or other 
protective container, such container shall not be considered to be the 
immediate container. In the case of color additive mixtures for 
household use containing less than 15 percent pure color, when two or 
more containers of 3 ounces each or less, each containing a different 
color, are distributed as a unit, the immediate container for such unit 
shall be considered to be the package as defined in this section.
    (u) The hair dye exemption in section 601(a) of the act applies to 
coal tar hair dyes intended for use in altering the color of the hair 
and which are, or which bear or contain, color additives derived from 
coal tar with the sensitization potential of causing skin irritation in 
certain individuals and possible blindness when used for dyeing the 
eyelashes or eyebrows. The exemption is permitted with the condition 
that the label of any such article bear conspicuously the statutory 
caution and adequate directions for preliminary patch-testing. The 
exemption does not apply to coloring ingredients in hair dyes not 
derived from coal tar, and it does not extend to poisonous or 
deleterious diluents that may be introduced as wetting agents, hair 
conditions, emulsifiers, or other components

[[Page 389]]

in a color shampoo, rinse, tint, or similar dual-purpose cosmetic that 
alter the color of the hair.
    (v) The terms externally applied drugs and externally applied 
cosmetics mean drugs or cosmetics applied only to external parts of the 
body and not to the lips or any body surface covered by mucous membrane.

[42 FR 15636, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 61 FR 14478, Apr. 2, 1996]



Sec.  70.5  General restrictions on use of color additives.

    (a) Color additives for use in the area of the eye. No listing or 
certification of a color additive shall be considered to authorize the 
use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in the 
area of the eye unless such listing or certification of such color 
additive specifically provides for such use. Any color additive used in 
or on any article intended for use in the area of the eye, the listing 
or certification of which color additive does not provide for such use, 
shall be considered to be a color additive not listed under parts 73, 
74, and 81 of this chapter, even though such color additive is certified 
and/or listed for other uses.
    (b) Color additives for use in injections. No listing or 
certification of a color additive shall be considered to authorize the 
use of any such color additive in any article intended for use in 
injections unless such listing or certification of such color additive 
specifically provides for such use. Any color additive used in or on any 
article intended for use in injections, the listing or certification of 
which color additive does not provide for such use, shall be considered 
to be a color additive not listed under parts 73, 74, and 81 of this 
chapter, even though such color additive is certified and/or listed for 
other uses.
    (c) Color additives for use in surgical sutures. No listing or 
certification of a color additive shall be considered to authorize the 
use of any such color additive in any article intended for use as a 
surgical suture unless such listing or certification of such color 
additive specifically provides for such use. Any color additive used in 
or on any article intended for use as a surgical suture, the listing or 
certification of which color additive does not provide for such use, 
shall be considered to be a color additive not listed under parts 73, 
74, and 81 of this chapter, even though such color additive is certified 
and/or listed for other uses.



Sec.  70.10  Color additives in standardized foods and new drugs.

    (a) Standardized foods. (1) Where a petition is received for 
issuance or amendment of a regulation establishing a definition and 
standard of identity for a food under section 401 of the act, which 
proposes the inclusion of a color additive in the standardized food, the 
provisions of the regulations in part 71 of this chapter shall apply 
with respect to the information that must be submitted with respect to 
the safety of the color additive (if such information has not previously 
been submitted and safety of the color additive for the intended use has 
not been already established), and the petition must show also that the 
use of the color additive in the standardized food would be in 
conformance with section 401 of the act or with the terms of a temporary 
permit issued under Sec.  130.17 of this chapter.
    (2) If a petition for a definition and standard of identity contains 
a proposal for a color additive regulation, and the petitioner fails to 
designate it as such, the Commissioner, upon determining that the 
petition includes a proposal for a color additive regulation, shall so 
notify the petitioner and shall thereafter proceed in accordance with 
the regulations in part 71 of this chapter.
    (3) A regulation will not be issued allowing the use of a color 
additive in a food for which a definition and standard of identity is 
established, unless its issuance is in conformance with section 401 of 
the act or with the terms of a temporary permit issued under Sec.  
130.17 of this chapter. When the contemplated use of such additive 
complies with the terms of a temporary permit, the color additive 
regulation will be conditioned on such compliance and will expire with 
the expiration of the temporary permit.
    (b) New drugs. (1) Where an application for a new drug is received 
and this

[[Page 390]]

application proposes, for coloring purposes only, the inclusion of a 
color additive, the provisions of the regulations in part 71 of this 
chapter shall apply with respect to the information that must be 
submitted about the safety of the color additive, if such information 
has not previously been submitted and safety of the color additive for 
the intended use has not already been established.
    (2) If an application for a new drug inferentially contains a 
proposal for a color additive regulation, and the applicant fails to 
designate it as such, the Commissioner, upon determining that the 
application includes a proposal for a color additive regulation, shall 
so notify the applicant and shall thereafter proceed in accordance with 
the regulations in part 71 of this chapter.
    (3) Where a petition for a color additive must be filed in 
accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the date of filing of 
the color additive petition shall be considered as the date of filing of 
the new-drug application.

[42 FR 15636, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 64 FR 400, Jan. 5, 1999]



Sec.  70.11  Related substances.

    (a) Different color additives may cause similar or related 
pharmacological or biological effects, and, in the absence of evidence 
to the contrary, those that do so will be considered to have additive 
toxic effects.
    (b) Food additives may also cause pharmacological or biological 
effects similar or related to such effects caused by color additives, 
and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, those that do so will 
be considered as having additive toxic effects.
    (c) Pesticide chemicals may also cause pharmacological or biological 
effects similar or related to such effects caused by color additives, 
and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, those that do so will 
be considered to have additive toxic effects.
    (d) In establishing tolerances for color additives, the Commissioner 
will take into consideration, among other things, the amount of any 
common component permitted in other color additives, in food additives, 
and in pesticide chemical residues as well as the similar biological 
activity (such as cholinesterase inhibition) produced by such substance.



Sec.  70.19  Fees for listing.

    (a) Each petition for the listing of a color additive shall be 
accompanied by a deposit of $3,000.00 if the proposal is for listing the

                    Subpart B_Packaging and Labeling



Sec.  70.20  Packaging requirements for straight colors
(other than hair dyes).

    Straight colors shall be packaged in containers which prevent 
changes in composition. Packages shall be sealed so that they cannot be 
opened without breaking the seal. An unavoidable change in moisture 
content caused by the ordinary and customary exposure that occurs in 
good storage, packing, and distribution practice is not considered a 
change in composition. If the packaging material is a food additive it 
shall be authorized by an appropriate regulation in parts 170 through 
189 of this chapter.



Sec.  70.25  Labeling requirements for color additives
(other than hair dyes).

    (a) General labeling requirements. All color additives shall be 
labeled with sufficient information to assure their safe use and to 
allow a determination of compliance with any limitations imposed by this 
part and parts 71, 73, 74, 80, and 81 of this chapter. In addition to

[[Page 392]]

all other information required by the act, labels for color additives, 
except those in a form suitable for coloring the human body, shall 
state:
    (1) The name of the straight color or the name of each ingredient 
comprising the color additive, if it is a mixture.
    (2) A statement indicating general limitations for the use of the 
color additive, such as ``for food use only''; ``for food, drug, and 
cosmetic use''; ``for use in drugs for external application only.''
    (3) Where regulations issued impose quantitative limitations for a 
general or specific use of a straight color, the amount of each such 
straight color in terms of weight per unit/volume or percent by weight.
    (4) An expiration date if stability data require it.
    (b) Special labeling for color additives with tolerances. Where 
tolerances are imposed for a general or specific use of a color 
additive, the label shall in addition provide directions for use of the 
color additive which if followed will preclude the food, drug, or 
cosmetic to which it is added from containing an amount of the color 
additive in excess of the tolerance.
    (c) Special labeling for color additives with other limitations. If 
use of the color additive is subject to other limitations prescribed in 
this part, such limitations shall be stated on the label of the color 
additive by a plain and conspicuous statement. Examples of such 
limitation statements are: ``Do not use in products used in the area of 
the eye''; ``Do not use for coloring drugs for injection.''
    (d) Special labeling for color additives not exempt from 
certification. Color additives not exempt from the certification 
procedures shall in addition include in the labeling the lot number 
assigned by the Color Certification Branch, except that in the case of 
any mixture for household use which contains not more than 15 percent of 
pure color and which is in packages containing not more than 3 ounces 
there appears on the label, a code number which the manufacturer has 
identified with the lot number by giving to the Food and Drug 
Administration written notice that such code number will be used in lieu 
of the lot number.



                       Subpart C_Safety Evaluation



Sec.  70.40  Safety factors to be considered.

    In accordance with section 721(b)(5)(A)(iii) of the act, the 
following safety factor will be applied in determining whether the 
proposed use of a color additive will be safe: Except where evidence is 
submitted which justifies use of a different safety factor, a safety 
factor of 100 to 1 will be used in applying animal experimentation data 
to man; that is, a color additive for use by man will not be granted a 
tolerance that will exceed 1/100th of the maximum no-effect level for 
the most susceptible experimental animals tested. The various species of 
experimental animals used in the tests shall conform to good 
pharmacological practice.



Sec.  70.42  Criteria for evaluating the safety of color additives.

    (a) In deciding whether a petition is complete and suitable for 
filing and in reaching a decision on any petition filed, the 
Commissioner will apply the ``safe-for-use'' principle. This will 
require the presentation of all needed scientific data in support of a 
proposed listing to assure that each listed color additive will be safe 
for its intended use or uses in or on food, drugs, or cosmetics. The 
Commissioner may list a color additive for use generally in or on food, 
in or on drugs, or in or on cosmetics when he finds from the data 
presented that such additive is suitable and may safely be employed for 
such general use; he may list an additive only for more limited use or 
uses for which it is proven suitable and may safely be employed; and he 
is authorized to prescribe broadly the conditions under which the 
additive may be safely employed for such use or uses. This may allow the 
use of a particular dye, pigment, or other substance with certain 
diluents, but not with others, or at a higher concentration with some 
than with others.
    (b) The safety for external color additives will normally be 
determined by tests for acute oral toxicity, primary irritation, 
sensitization, subacute dermal toxicity on intact and abraded skin, and 
carcinogenicity by skin application. The Commissioner may waive any of 
such tests if data before

[[Page 393]]

him otherwise establish that such test is not required to determine 
safety for the use proposed.
    (c) Upon written request describing the proposed use of a color 
additive and the proposed experiments to determine its safety, the 
Commissioner will advise a person who wishes to establish the safety of 
a color additive whether he believes the experiments planned will yield 
data adequate for an evaluation of the safety of the additive.



Sec.  70.45  Allocation of color additives.

    Whenever, in the consideration of a petition or a proposal to list a 
color additive or to alter an existing listing, the data before the 
Commissioner fail to show that it would be safe to list the color 
additive for all the uses proposed or at the levels proposed, the 
Commissioner will notify the petitioner and other interested persons by 
publication in the Federal Register that it is necessary to allocate the 
safe tolerance for the straight color in the color additive among the 
competing needs. This notice shall call for the presentation of data by 
all interested persons on which the allocation can be made in accordance 
with section 721(b)(8) of the act. The time for acting upon the petition 
shall be stayed until such data are presented, whereupon the time limits 
shall begin to run anew. As promptly as possible after presentation of 
the data, the Commissioner will, by order, announce the allocation and 
the tolerance limitations.



Sec.  70.50  Application of the cancer clause of section 721 of the act.

    (a) Color additives that may be ingested. Whenever (1) the 
scientific data before the Commissioner (either the reports from the 
scientific literature or the results of biological testing) suggest the 
possibility that the color additive including its components or 
impurities has induced cancer when ingested by man or animal; or (2) 
tests which are appropriate for the evaluation of the safety of 
additives in food suggest that the color additive, including its 
components or impurities, induces cancer in man or animal, the 
Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of 
appropriately qualified scientists, cancer has been induced and whether 
the color additive, including its components or impurities, was the 
causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not 
establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable; and if the 
data considered as a whole establish that the color additive will be 
safe under the conditions that can be specified in the applicable 
regulation, it may be listed for such use. But if in the judgment of the 
Commissioner, based on information from qualified scientists, cancer has 
been induced, no regulation may issue which permits its use.
    (b) Color additives that will not be ingested. Whenever the 
scientific data before the Commissioner suggest the possibility that the 
color additive, including its components or impurities, has induced 
cancer in man or animals by routes other than ingestion, the 
Commissioner shall determine whether, based on the judgment of 
appropriately qualified scientists, the test suggesting the possibility 
of carcinogenesis is appropriate for the evaluation of the color 
additive for a use which does not involve ingestion, cancer has been 
induced, and the color additive, including its components or impurities, 
was the causative substance. If it is his judgment that the data do not 
establish these facts, the cancer clause is not applicable to preclude 
external drug and cosmetic uses, and if the data as a whole establish 
that the color additive will be safe under conditions that can be 
specified in the regulations, it may be listed for such use. But if, in 
the judgment of the Commissioner, based on information from qualified 
scientists, the test is an appropriate one for the consideration of 
safety for the proposed external use, and cancer has been induced by the 
color additive, including its components or impurities, no regulation 
may issue which permits its use in external drugs and cosmetics.
    (c) Color additives for use as an ingredient of feed for animals 
that are raised for food production. Color additives that are an 
ingredient of the feed for animals raised for food production and that

Office of Food Additive Safety (HFS-200),
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition,
Food and Drug Administration,
5100 Paint Branch Pkwy.,
College Park, MD 20740
Dear Sir:
    Petitioner submits this pursuant to section 721(b)(1) of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requesting listing by the Commissioner of 
the color additive ---------- as suitable and safe for use in or on ----
------ subject to the conditions that --------------. [Petitioner may 
propose a listing for general use in food, drugs, or cosmetics or, if 
such general listing is not believed suitable and safe, the petitioner 
shall describe the conditions under which he believes the additive can 
be safely used and for which it will be suitable. These conditions may 
include tolerance limitations, specifications as to the manner in which 
the additive may be added or used, and directions and other labeling or 
packaging safeguards that should be applied. The level of use proposed 
should not be higher than reasonably required to accomplish the intended 
color effect.]
    Attached hereto, in triplicate (quadruplicate, if intended uses 
include uses in meat, meat food product, or poultry product), and 
constituting a part of this petition are the following:
    A. The name and all pertinent information concerning the color 
additive, including chemical identity and composition of the color 
additive, its physical, chemical, and biological properties, and 
specifications prescribing its component(s) and identifying and limiting 
the reaction byproducts and other impurities.
    The petition shall contain a description of the chemical and 
physical tests relied upon to identify the color additive and shall 
contain a full description of the methods used in, and the facilities 
and controls used for, the production of the color additive. These shall 
establish that it is a substance of reproducible composition. 
Alternative methods and controls and variations in methods and controls, 
within reasonable limits, that do not affect the characteristics of the 
substance or the reliability of the controls may be specified.
    The petition shall supply a list of all substances used in the 
synthesis, extraction, or other method of preparation of any straight 
color, regardless of whether they undergo chemical change in the 
process. Each substance should be identified by its common or usual name 
and its complete chemical name, using structural formulas when necessary 
for specific identification. If any proprietary preparation is used as a 
component, the proprietary name should be followed by a complete 
quantitive statement of composition. Reasonable alternatives for any 
listed substance may be specified.
    If the petitioner does not himself perform all the manufacturing, 
processing, and packing operations for a color additive, the petitioner 
shall identify each person who will perform a part of such operations 
and designate the part.
    The petition shall include stability data, and, if the data indicate 
that it is needed to insure the identity, strength, quality, or purity 
of the color additive, the expiration period that will be employed as 
well as any packaging and labeling precautions needed to preserve 
stability.
    B. The amount of the color additive proposed for use and the color 
effect intended to be achieved, together with all directions, 
recommendations, and suggestions regarding the proposed use, as well as 
specimens of the labeling proposed for the color additive. If the color 
effect results or may reasonably be expected to result from use of the 
color additive in packaging material, the petitioner shall show how this 
may occur and what residues may reasonably be anticipated.
    Typewritten or other draft-labeling copy will be accepted for 
consideration of the petition provided final printed labeling identical 
in content to the draft copy is submitted as soon as available, and 
prior to the marketing of the color additive. The printed labeling shall 
conform in prominence and conspicuousness with the requirements of the 
act.
    If the color additive is one for which a tolerance limitation is 
required to assure its safety, the level of use proposed should be no 
higher than the amount reasonably required to accomplish the intended 
physical or other technical effect, even though the safety data may 
support a higher tolerance. If the safety data will not support the use 
of the amount of the color additive reasonably needed to accomplish the 
desired color effect, the requested tolerance will not be established. 
Petitioners are expected to propose the use of color additives in 
accordance with sound color chemistry.
    C.1. A description of practicable methods to determine the pure 
color and all intermediates, subsidiary colors, and other components of 
the color additive.
    2. A description of practicable methods to determine the amount of 
the color additive in any raw, processed, and/or finished food, drug, or 
cosmetic in which use of the color additive is proposed. (The tests 
proposed shall be those that can be used for food, drug, or cosmetic 
control purposes and can be applied with consistent results by any 
properly equipped laboratory and trained personnel.)
    3. A description of methods for identification and determination of 
any substance formed in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic because of 
the use of the color additive. (If it

[[Page 396]]

is the petitioner's view that any such method would not be needed, under 
the terms of section 721(b)(5)(A)(iv), a statement shall be submitted in 
lieu of methods as to the basis for such view.)
    D. Full reports of investigation made with respect to the safety of 
the color additive.
    (A petition will be regarded as incomplete unless it includes full 
reports of adequate tests reasonably applicable to show whether or not 
the color additive will be safe for its intended use. The reports 
ordinarily should include detailed data derived from appropriate animal 
and other biological experiments in which the methods used and the 
results obtained are clearly set forth. The petition shall not omit 
without explanation any data that would influence the evaluation of the 
safety of the color additive).
    E. Complete data which will allow the Commissioner to consider, 
among other things, the probable consumption of, and/or other relevant 
exposure from the additive and of any substance formed in or on food, 
drugs, or cosmetics because of such additive; and the cumulative effect, 
if any, of such additive in the diet of man or animals, taking into 
account the same or any chemically or pharmacologically related 
substance or substances in the diet including, but not limited to food 
additives and pesticide chemicals for which tolerances or exemptions 
from tolerances have been established.
    F. Proposed tolerances and other limitations on the use of the color 
additive, if tolerances and limitations are required in order to insure 
its safety. A petitioner may include a proposed regulation.
    G. If exemption from batch certification is requested, the reasons 
why it is believed such certification is not necessary (including 
supporting data to establish the safety of the intended use).
    H. If submitting a petition to alter an existing regulation issued 
pursuant to section 721(b) of the act, full information on each proposed 
change that is to be made in the original regulation must be submitted. 
The petition may omit statements made in the original petition 
concerning which no change is proposed. A supplemental petition must be 
submitted for any change beyond the variations provided for in the 
original petition and the regulation issued on the basis of the original 
petition.
    I. The prescribed fee of $------------ for admitting the color 
additive to listing is enclosed (unless there is an advance deposit 
adequate to cover the fee).

Yours very truly,
(Petitioner)____________________________________________________________

Sec.  71.2  Notice of filing of petition.

    (a) Except where the petition involves a new drug, the Commissioner, 
within 15 days after receipt, will notify the petitioner of acceptance 
or nonacceptance of a petition, and if not accepted the reasons 
therefor. If accepted, the date of the notification letter sent to 
petitioner becomes the date of filing for the purposes of section 
721(d)(1) of the act. If the petitioner desires, he may supplement a 
deficient petition after being notified regarding deficiencies. If the 
supplementary material or explanation of the petition is deemed 
acceptable, petitioner shall be notified. The date of such notification 
becomes the date of filing. If the petitioner does not wish to 
supplement or explain the petition and requests in writing that it be 
filed as submitted, the petition shall be filed and the petitioner so 
notified. The date of such notification becomes the date of filing. 
Where the petition involves a new drug, notification to the petitioner 
will be made in accordance with Sec.  70.10(b)(3) of this chapter.
    (b) The Commissioner will cause to be published in the Federal 
Register within 30 days from the date of filing of such petition a 
notice of the filing, the name of the petitioner, and a brief 
description of the proposal in general terms. A copy of the notice will 
be mailed to the petitioner when the original document is signed.

[42 FR 15639, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 64 FR 400, Jan. 5, 1999]



Sec.  71.4  Samples; additional information.

    The Commissioner may request samples of the color additive, articles 
used as components thereof, or of the food, drug, or cosmetic in which 
the color additive is proposed to be used, or which comprises the color 
additive, and any additional information needed to clarify a submitted 
method or other aspect of a petition at any time while a petition is 
under consideration. The Commissioner shall specify in the request for a 
sample of the color additive, or articles used as components thereof, or 
of the food, drug, or cosmetic in which the color additive is proposed 
to be used, or which comprises the color additive, a quantity deemed 
adequate to permit tests of analytical methods to determine quantities 
of the color additive present in products for which it is intended to be 
used or adequate for any study or investigation reasonably required with 
respect to the safety of the color additive or the physical or technical 
effect it produces. The date used for computing the 90-day limit for the 
purposes of section 721(d)(1) of the act shall be moved forward 1 day 
for each day, after mailing date of the request, taken by the petitioner 
to submit the information and/or sample. If the information or sample is 
requested a reasonable time in advance of the 180 days, but is not 
submitted within such 180 days after filing of the petition, the 
petition will be considered withdrawn without prejudice.



Sec.  71.6  Extension of time for studying petitions; substantive
amendments; withdrawal of petitions without prejudice.

    (a) Extension of time for studying petitions. If the Commissioner 
determines that additional time is needed to study and investigate the 
petition, he shall by written notice to the petitioner extend the 90-day 
period for not more than 180 days after the filing of the petition.

[[Page 398]]

    (b) Substantive amendments. After a petition has been filed, the 
petitioner may submit additional information or data in support thereof. 
In such cases, if the Commissioner determines that the additional 
information or data amounts to a substantive amendment, the petition as 
amended will be given a new filing date, and the time limitation will 
begin to run anew. If nonclinical laboratory studies are involved, 
additional information and data submitted in support of filed petitions 
shall include, with respect to each nonclinical laboratory study 
contained in the petition, either a statement that the study was 
conducted in compliance with the requirements set forth in part 58 of 
this chapter, or, if the study was not conducted in compliance with such 
regulations, a brief statement of the reason for the noncompliance. If 
clinical investigations involving human subjects are involved, 
additional information or data submitted in support of filed petitions 
shall include statements regarding each such clinical investigation from 
which the information or data are derived, that it either was conducted 
in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth 
in part 56 of this chapter, or was not subject to such requirements in 
accordance with Sec.  56.104 or Sec.  56.105, and that it was conducted 
in compliance with the requirements for informed consent set forth in 
part 50 of this chapter.
    (c) Withdrawal of petitions without prejudice. (1) In some cases the 
Commissioner may notify the petitioner that the petition, while 
technically complete, is inadequate to justify the establishment of a 
regulation or the regulation requested by petitioner. This may be due to 
the fact that the data are not sufficiently clear or complete. In such 
cases, the petitioner may withdraw the petition pending its 
clarification or the obtaining of additional data. This withdrawal will 
be without prejudice to a future filing. Upon refiling, the time 
limitation will begin to run anew from the date of refiling.
    (2) At any time before the order provided for in Sec.  71.20 has 
been forwarded to the Federal Register for publication the petitioner 
may withdraw the petition without prejudice to a future filing. Upon 
refiling, the time limitation will begin to run anew.

established in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter, and a notation shall be made 
that any such ingredient list is incomplete.
    (5) An assay method or other analytical method, unless it serves no 
regulatory or compliance purpose and is shown to fall within the 
exemption established in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter.
    (6) All records showing the Food and Drug Administration's testing 
of or action on a particular lot of a certifiable color additive.

[[Page 399]]

    (b) The following data and information in a color additive petition 
are not available for public disclosure unless they have been previously 
disclosed to the public as defined in Sec.  20.81 of this chapter or 
they relate to a product or ingredient that has been abandoned and they 
no longer represent a trade secret or confidential commercial or 
financial information as defined in Sec.  20.61 of this chapter:
    (1) Manufacturing methods or processes, including quality control 
procedures.
    (2) Production, sales, distribution, and similar data and 
information, except that any compilation of such data and information 
aggregated and prepared in a way that does not reveal data or 
information which is not available for public disclosure under this 
provision is available for public disclosure.
    (3) Quantitative or semiquantitative formulas.
    (c) All correspondence and written summaries of oral discussions 
relating to a color additive petition are available for public

additive mixture may petition for an exemption from certification 
pursuant to part 10 of this chapter. Any such petition shall show why 
such certification is not necessary for the protection of public health.



              Subpart B_Administrative Action on Petitions



Sec.  71.20  Publication of regulation.

    The Commissioner will forward for publication in the Federal 
Register, within 90 days after filing of the petition (or within 180 
days if the time is extended as provided for in section 721(d)(1) of the 
act):
    (a) A regulation listing in part 73 or 74 of this chapter the color 
additive on the appropriate list or lists as provided under section 
721(b)(1).
    (1) Such a regulation may list the color additive for use generally 
in or on foods, drugs, or cosmetics or for use in coloring the human 
body, as the case may be, or may prescribe the conditions under which 
the color additive may be safely used (including, but not limited to, 
specifications as to the particular food, drug, or cosmetic or classes 
of food, drugs, or cosmetics in or on which such color additive may be 
used, or for the material intended for coloring the human body; the 
maximum quantity of any straight color or diluent that may be used or 
permitted to remain in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic or article 
intended for coloring the human body; the manner in which such color 
additive may be added to or used in or on such food, drug, or cosmetic 
or for coloring the human body; and any directions or other labeling or 
packing requirements for such color additives deemed necessary to assure 
the safety of such use).
    (2) Such regulations shall list the color additive only for the use 
or uses for which it has been found suitable and for which it may safely 
be employed. Alternatively, the Commissioner shall by order deny the 
petition, and notify the petitioner of such order and the reasons 
therefor.
    (3) The regulation shall list any use or uses in meat, meat food 
product, or poultry product subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act 
(FMIA) (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) or the Poultry Products Inspection (PPIA) 
(21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.) for which the color additive has been found 
suitable and for which it may safely be employed.
    (b) Whenever the Commissioner finds that batch certification is not 
necessary for the protection of the public health he will, by order, 
exempt the color additive from the certification procedure. In 
determining whether certification of a color additive is necessary, the 
Commissioner will consider the composition of the additive, its

[[Page 400]]

manufacturing process, possible impurities, its toxic potential, control 
and analytical procedures necessary to assure compliance with the 
listing specifications, and the variability of its composition.

[42 FR 15639, Mar. 22, 1977, as amended at 65 FR 51762, Aug. 25, 2000]



Sec.  71.22  Deception as a basis for refusing to issue regulations;
deceptive use of a color additive for which a regulation has issued.

    The Commissioner shall refuse to issue a regulation listing a color 
additive, if in his judgment the data before him show that such proposed 
use would promote deception of the consumer or would result in 
misbranding or adulteration within the meaning of the act. Such a 
finding shall be by order published in the Federal Register subject to 
the filing of objections and a request for a hearing by adversely 
affected parties. The issuance of a regulation for a color additive 
authorizing its use generally in or on a food, drug, or cosmetic shall 
not be construed as authorization to use the color additive in a manner 
that may promote deception or conceal damage or inferiority. The use of 
a color additive to promote deception or conceal damage or inferiority 
shall be considered as the use of a color additive for which no 
regulation has issued pursuant to section 721(b) of the act, even though 
the regulation is effective for other uses.



Sec.  71.25  Condition for certification.

    (a) When the Commissioner cannot conclude from the information 
before him that there is a basis for exempting a color additive from the 
requirement of batch certification, he will so order by appropriate 
listing in part 74 of this chapter. The Commissioner's order shall state 
in detail the specifications that shall be met by the color additive.
    (b) Each order shall state a period of time after which use of a 
color additive subject to batch certification but not from a batch 
certified by procedure prescribed in this section would result in 
adulteration of the product in which it is used.



Sec.  71.26  Revocation of exemption from certification.

    If information becomes available to the Commissioner that a color 
additive that has been granted exemption from certification should not, 
for the protection of the public health, be so exempted, such exemption 
will be canceled by a notice published in the Federal Register.



Sec.  71.27  Listing and exemption from certification on the 
Commissioner's initiative.

    Where a petition for a regulation to list a color additive has not 
been received and the Commissioner has available facts which demonstrate 
that a color additive should be listed and/or that certification 
procedure is not necessary in order to protect the public health, he may 
list such color additive by appropriate regulation and listing in part 
73 or 74 of this chapter.



Sec.  71.30  Procedure for filing objections to regulations.

    (a) Objections and hearings relating to color additive regulations 
under section 721 (b) and (c) of the act shall be governed by parts 10, 
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 19 of this chapter.
    (b) The fees specified in Sec.  70.19 of this chapter shall be 
applicable.



Sec.  71.37  Exemption of color additives for investigational
use.

    (a) A shipment or other delivery of a color additive or of a food, 
drug, or cosmetic containing such a color additive for investigational 
use by experts qualified to determine safety shall be exempt from the 
requirements of section 402(c), 501(a), or 601(e) of the act, provided 
that the color additive or the food, drug, or cosmetic containing the 
color additive bears a label which states prominently, ``Caution--
Contains new color additive--For investigational use only.'' No animals 
used in such investigations, or their products, such as milk or eggs, 
shall be used for food purposes, unless the sponsor or the investigator 
has submitted to the Commissioner data demonstrating that such use will 
be consistent with the public health, and the Commissioner, proceeding 
as he would in a matter involving section 409(i) of

the act, has notified the sponsor or investigator that the proposed 
disposition for food is authorized. Any person who contests a refusal to 
grant such authorization shall have an opportunity for a regulatory 
hearing before the Food and Drug Administration pursuant to part 16 of 
this chapter.
    (b) The person who introduced such shipment or who delivers the 
color additive or a food, drug, or cosmetic containing such an additive 
into interstate commerce shall maintain adequate records showing the 
name and post-office address of the expert to whom the color additive is 
shipped, date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment and 
delivery for a period of 2 years after such shipment and delivery. Upon 
the request of a properly authorized employee of the Department, at 
reasonable times, he shall make such records available for inspection

Sec.  80.22  Samples to accompany requests for certification.

    A sample of a batch of color additive which is to accompany a 
request for certification shall:
    (a) Be taken only after such batch has been so thoroughly mixed as 
to be of uniform composition throughout.
    (b) Held under the control of the person requesting certification 
until certified.
    (c) Be labeled to show:
    (1) The name of the color additive.
    (2) The manufacturer's batch number.
    (3) The quantity of such batch.
    (4) The name and post-office address of the person requesting 
certification of such batch.
    (5) Be accompanied by any label or labeling intended to be used.



Sec.  80.31  Certification.

    (a) If the Commissioner determines, after such investigations as he 
considers to be necessary, that:
    (1) A request submitted in accordance with Sec.  80.21 appears to 
contain no untrue statement of a material fact;
    (2) Such color additive conforms to the specifications and any other 
conditions set forth therefor in parts 81 and 82 of this chapter.
    (3) The batch covered by such request otherwise appears to comply 
with the regulations in this chapter, the Commissioner shall issue to 
the person who submitted such request a certificate showing the lot 
number assigned to such batch and that such batch, subject to the terms, 
conditions, and restrictions prescribed by part 74, 81, and 82 of this 
chapter, is a certified batch.
    (b) If the Commissioner determines, after such investigation as he 
considers to be necessary, that a request submitted in accordance with 
Sec.  80.21, or the batch of color additive covered by

[[Page 495]]

such request, does not comply with the requirements prescribed by 
paragraph (a) of this section for the issuance of a certificate, the 
Commissioner shall refuse to certify such batch and shall give notice 
thereof to the person who submitted such request, stating his reasons 
for refusal. Any person who contests such refusal shall have an 
opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.



Sec.  80.32  Limitations of certificates.

    (a) If a certificate is obtained through fraud or misrepresentation 
of a material fact, such certificate shall not be effective, and a color 
additive from the batch on which such certificate was issued shall be 
considered to be from a batch that has not been certified in accordance 
with the regulations in this part. Whenever, the Commissioner learns 
that any certificate has been obtained through fraud or material 
misrepresentation, he shall notify the holder of the certificate that it 
is of no effect.
    (b) If between the time a sample of color additive accompanying a 
request for certification is taken and the time a certificate covering 
the batch of such color additive is received by the person to whom it is 
issued, any such color additive becomes changed in composition, such 
certificates shall not be effective with respect to such changed color 
additive and such changed color additive shall be considered to be from 
a batch that has not been certified in accordance with the regulations 
in this part.
    (c) If at any time after a certificate is received by the person to 
whom it is issued any color additive from the batch covered by such 
certificate becomes changed in composition, such certificate shall 
expire with respect to such changed color additive. After such 
expiration, such color additive shall be considered to be from a batch 
that has not been certified in accordance with this part; except that 
such color additive shall not be so considered when used for coloring a 
food, drug, or cosmetic, or for the purpose of certifying a batch of a 
mixture in which such color additive was used as an ingredient, or for 
use in preparing a batch of a mixture for which exemption from 
certification has been authorized, if such change resulted solely from 
such use.
    (d) A certificate shall expire with respect to any color additive 
covered thereby if the package in which such color additive was closed 
for shipment or delivery is opened. After such expiration such color 
additive shall be considered to be from a batch that has not been 
certified, except that such color additive shall not be so considered 
when the package is opened;
    (1) and such color additive is used, subject to the restrictions 
prescribed by paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section, in coloring 
a food, drug, or cosmetic;
    (2) for the purpose of certifying a batch made by repacking such 
color;
    (3) for the purpose of certifying a batch of a mixture in which such 
color is used as an ingredient; or
    (4) for the purpose of preparing a batch of a mixture for which 
exemption from certification has been authorized; or
    (5) when the package is reopened solely for repackaging by the 
person to whom such certificate was issued.
    (e) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package 
of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from 
a batch that has not been certified if such package is shipped or 
delivered under a label which does not bear all words, statements, and 
other information required by Sec.  70.25 of this chapter to appear 
thereon.
    (f) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package 
of color additive, and such color additive shall be considered to be 
from a batch that has not been certified if:
    (1) Such package has not been sealed in accordance with Sec.  70.20 
of this chapter.
    (2) Such package has been sealed in accordance with Sec.  70.20 of 
this chapter and the seal has been broken, intentionally or 
accidentally, unless such seal has been broken for the purpose of using 
color additive in accordance with Sec.  80.38, or, such package has been 
opened by a duly authorized representative of the Administration or 
Department in the performance of his official

[[Page 496]]

duties, and he has immediately resealed the package in conformance with 
Sec.  70.20 of this chapter.
    (g) A certificate shall not be effective with respect to a package 
of color additive and such color additive shall be considered to be from 
a batch that has not been certified if such color additive is used in 
any manner other than that for which it was certified.
    (h) When the listing or the specifications for a color additive are 
revoked or amended, the final order effecting the revocation or 
amendment may specify, in addition to its own effective date, a date on 
which all certificates for existing batches and portions of batches of 
such a color additive theretofore issued under such revoked or amended 
regulations shall cease to be effective; and any such lots of the color 
additive shall be regarded as uncertified after the date specified 
unless a new certificate can be and is obtained in conformance with the 
new regulations. When a certificate thus ceases to be effective for a 
color additive, any certificates previously issued for a color additive 
mixture containing that color additive shall cease to be effective on 
the same date. Use of such color additive or color additive mixture 
after such specified date without the new certificate in preparing 
foods, drugs, or cosmetics will result in such food, drugs, or cosmetics 
being adulterated. When a certified color additive has been used in 
food, drugs, or cosmetics and the status of the color additive is 
thereafter changed by amendment or revocation of its listing or 
specification regulations, such food, drugs, and cosmetics will not be 
regarded as adulterated by reason of the use of such color additive, 
unless the hazard to health is such that existing stocks of the foods, 
drugs, or cosmetics cannot be safely used, in which cases findings to 
that effect will be made and regulations appropriate for such special 
cases will be issued.



Sec.  80.34  Authority to refuse certification service.

    (a) When it appears to the Commissioner that a person has:
    (1) Obtained, or attempted to obtain, a certificate through fraud or 
misrepresentation of a material fact.
    (2) Falsified the records required to be kept by Sec.  80.39; or
    (3) Failed to keep such records, or to make them available, or to 
accord full opportunity to make inventory of stocks on hand or otherwise 
to check the correctness of such records, as required by Sec.  80.39; or
    (4) Refused to permit duly authorized employees of the Food and Drug 
Administration free access to all manufacturing facilities, processes, 
and formulae involved in the manufacture of color additives and 
intermediates from which such color additives are derived; he may 
immediately suspend certification service to such person and may 
continue such suspension until adequate corrective action has been 
taken.
    (b) Any person who contests suspension of service shall have an 
opportunity for a regulatory hearing before the Food and Drug 
Administration pursuant to part 16 of this chapter.



Sec.  80.35  Color additive mixtures; certification and exemption 
from certification.

    (a) Color additive mixtures to be certified. Any color additive 
mixture that contains one or more straight colors listed in part 74 of 
this chapter, together with any diluents listed in such subparts for use 
with such straight colors, shall be certified if intended for use in 
foods, drugs, or cosmetics, or in coloring the human body, as the case 
may be, subject to any restriction prescribed in parts 70 and 71 of this 
chapter.
    (b) Color additive mixtures exempted from certification. A color 
additive mixture prepared from a previously certified batch of one or 
more straight colors, with or without any diluent that has been listed 
in part 73 of this chapter for use in mixtures, shall be exempt from 
batch certification if the straight color used has not changed in 
composition in any manner whatsoever since its certification and if it 
is simply mixed with the approved diluents for exempt mixtures. The 
label of such color additive mixtures shall not bear the lot number 
assigned by the Food and Drug Administration to the certified straight 
color components, but shall bear the manufacturer's control

[[Page 497]]

number through which the history of the straight color can be 
determined.
    (c) Additions to the list of diluents. A person requesting additions 
to the list of diluents authorized for the purposes described in 
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall submit a petition in 
accordance with the provisions of Sec.  71.1 of this chapter. Each such 
petition shall be accompanied by the fee prescribed in Sec.  70.19 of 
this chapter, unless there is an advance deposit to be used for 
prepayment of such fees.

section of the printed volume and at www.fdsys.gov.



Sec.  81.10  Termination of provisional listings of color additives.

    (a) Ext. D&C Yellow Nos. 9 and 10. These colors cannot be produced 
with any assurance that they do not contain [beta]-naphthylamine as an 
impurity. While it has been asserted that the two colors can be produced 
without the impurity named, no method of analysis has been suggested to 
establish the fact. [beta]-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; 
therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe 
tolerance for these colors in products to be used in contact with the 
skin. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having concluded that such 
action is necessary to protect the public health, hereby terminated the 
provisional listing of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 9 and Ext. D&C Yellow No. 10.
    (b) [Reserved]
    (c) FD&C Red No. 1. Results of recent feeding tests of this color 
additive have demonstrated it to be toxic upon ingestion:
    (1) Groups of 50 rats are being fed diets containing FD&C Red No. 1 
at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 0.5 percent, and 0 
percent. At this stage of the tests, which have now been in progress for 
from 15 months to 18 months, 116 animals from the 250 being fed FD&C Red 
No. 1 at various levels and 27 of the 100 controls have died. Of these, 
11 being fed at the 5 percent level, 16 being fed at the 2 percent 
level, 11 being fed at the 1 percent level, and 2 being fed at the 0.5 
percent level, have shown liver damage. None of the controls that have 
died have shown liver damage.
    (2) Groups of 100 mice are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 
percent, 0.5 percent, and 0.1 percent FD&C Red No. 1, with 400 mice as 
controls. All mice on dosage levels of 2 percent and 1 percent died 
before the seventieth week. Gross liver damage has been observed in all 
groups fed at the 0.5 percent diet and above.
    (3) Groups of 4 dogs are being fed diets containing 2 percent, 1 
percent, 0.25 percent, and 0 percent FD&C Red No. 1. Three of the dogs 
on the 2 percent dosage level died before 32 weeks; the other is living. 
Three of the dogs on the 1 percent dosage level died or were

[[Page 499]]

sacrificed within 13 months. All deceased or sacrificed dogs have shown 
liver damage grossly and/or microscopically. Deceased dogs on the 1 
percent and 2 percent dosage level showed poor physical condition.

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs having concluded that ingestion of 
this color additive over a long period of time would be unsafe, and in 
order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional 
listing of FD&C Red No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
    (d) FD&C Red No. 4. Feeding tests of this color additive have been 
conducted with three species:
    (1) Rats of the Osborne-Mendel and Sprague-Dawley strains were fed 
FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 years at levels of 5 percent, 2 percent, 1 percent, 
and 0.5 percent of the diet. No effect was found.
    (2) Mice of the C3Hf and C57BL strains were fed FD&C Red No. 4 for 2 
years at levels of 2 percent and 1 percent of the diet. No effect was 
found.
    (3) Dogs were fed FD&C Red No. 4 at levels of 2 percent and 1 
percent of the diet. Adverse effects were found at both levels in the 
urinary bladder and in the adrenals. Three dogs of five fed on the 2-
percent level died after 6 months, 9 months, and 5\1/2\ years on the 
test. Two of the dogs on the 2-percent level and all five of the dogs on 
the 1-percent level survived to the completion of the 7 year study.

The Commissioner of Food and Drugs has concluded that available data do 
not permit the establishment of a safe level of use of this color 
additive in food, ingested drugs and ingested cosmetics. In order to 
protect the public health, the Commissioner hereby terminates the 
provisional listing of FD&C Red No. 4 for use in food and ingested 
drugs. The Commissioner has previously terminated the provisional 
listing of FD&C Red No. 4 for use in ingested cosmetics. FD&C Red No. 4 
is listed for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics by 
Sec. Sec.  74.1304 and 74.2304 of this chapter, respectively. Section 
82.304 of this chapter is retained in part 82 of this chapter to permit 
the use of lakes of FD&C Red No. 4 in externally applied drugs and 
cosmetics.
    (e) FD&C Violet No. 1. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order 
to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing 
of FD&C Violet No. 1 for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics.
    (f) FD&C Red No. 2. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to 
protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of 
FD&C Red No. 2 for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics.
    (g) Carbon black (prepared by the ``impingement'' or ``channel'' 
process). The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the 
public health, hereby terminates the provisional listing of carbon black 
(prepared by the impingement or channel process) for use in food, drugs, 
and cosmetics.
    (h) D&C Red Nos. 10, 11, 12, and 13. The petition for these color 
additives was withdrawn so that there no longer exists a basis for their 
continued provisional listing. In addition, the Commissioner has learned 
of the possible contamination of D&C Red No. 10, D&C Red No. 11, D&C Red 
No. 12, and D&C Red No. 13 with [beta]-naphthyl-amine. The Commissioner 
concludes that these colors cannot be produced with any reasonable 
assurance that they will not contain [beta]-naphthylamine as an impurity 
or not yield [beta]-naphthylamine from the metabolism of subsidiary 
colors present in them. [beta]-Naphthylamine is a known carcinogen; 
therefore, there is no scientific evidence that will support a safe 
tolerance for these colors in drugs or cosmetics. The Commissioner of 
Food and Drugs, upon withdrawal of the petition for their use and in 
order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional 
listing of D&C Red No. 10, D&C Red No. 11, D&C Red No. 12, and D&C Red 
No. 13 for use in drugs and cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
    (i) Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1. The Commissioner has learned of the 
contamination of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 with 4-aminobiphenyl. The 
Commissioner concludes that this color cannot be produced with any 
reasonable assurance that it will not contain 4-aminobiphenyl as an 
impurity or not yield benzidine from the decomposition of a subsidiary 
reaction product that might be present in the color. 4-

[[Page 500]]

Aminobiphenyl and benzidine are known carcinogens; therefore, there is 
no scientific evidence that will support a safe tolerance for these 
colors in drugs or cosmetics. In addition, insufficient data have been 
submitted to permit establishment of appropriate specifications for the 
batch certification of the color. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in 
order to protect the public health, hereby terminates the provisional 
listing of Ext. D&C Yellow No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and 
cosmetics, effective December 13, 1977.
    (j) Graphite. Data have been developed that show the contamination 
of graphite with polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PNA's). There is no 
reasonable assurance this color can be produced so that it will not 
contain PNA's as an impurity. The presence of certain PNA's in graphite 
would indicate that PNA's known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans 
may also be present. Therefore, there is no scientific evidence that 
will support a safe tolerance for this color in drugs or cosmetics. The 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in order to protect the public health, 
hereby terminates the provisional listing of graphite for use in 
externally applied cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
    (k) Ext. D&C Green No. 1. The Commissioner concludes that there are 
inadequate analytical methods to permit certification of the color 
additive Ext. D&C Green No. 1. In addition, the Commissioner has found 
that there was a failure to comply with the conditions attached to the 
postponement of the closing date in accordance with section 203(a)(2) of 
the transitional provisions of the Color Additive Amendments of 1960. 
The Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional 
listing of Ext. D&C Green No. 1 for use in externally applied drugs and 
cosmetics, effective November 29, 1977.
    (l) [Reserved]
    (m) D&C Orange Nos. 10 and 11. In the absense of a petition to list 
D&C Orange No. 10 and D&C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and 
cosmetics, there no longer exists a basis for provisional listing for 
such uses. Therefore, FDA is terminating the provisional listing of D&C 
Orange No. 10 and D&C Orange No. 11 for use in ingested drugs and 
cosmetics, effective April 28, 1981.
    (n) D&C Blue No. 6. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, having 
concluded that unresolved questions remain concerning the chemistry of 
unidentified minor components, hereby terminates the provisional listing 
of D&C Blue No. 6 for use in drugs and cosmetics.
    (o) D&C Green No. 6. In the absence of a petition to list D&C Green 
No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, there no longer exists a 
basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional listing 
of D&C Green No. 6 for use in ingested drugs and cosmetics, effective 
March 27, 1981.
    (p) [Reserved]
    (q)(1) D&C Red No. 19 and D&C Red No. 37. Having concluded that, 
when ingested, D&C Red No. 19 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency 
hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&C Red No. 19 and 
chemically related D&C Red No. 37 for use in ingested drugs and ingested 
cosmetics, effective February 4, 1983.
    (2) D&C Red No. 37. In the absence of a petition to list D&C Red No. 
37 for external uses, there no longer exists a basis for provisional 
listing for such uses. Accordingly, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs 
hereby terminates the provisional listings of D&C Red No. 37 for use in 
externally applied drugs and cosmetics, effective June 6, 1986.
    (r) [Reserved]
    (s) D&C Orange No. 17. Having concluded that, when ingested, D&C 
Orange No. 17 causes cancer in rats and mice, the agency has terminated 
the provisional listing of D&C Orange No. 17 for use in ingested drugs 
and ingested cosmetics, effective March 31, 1983.
    (t) D&C Red No. 8 and D&C Red No. 9. In the absence of a petition to 
list D&C Red No. 8 and D&C Red No. 9 for mouthwash, dentifrices, and 
ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, there no longer 
exists a basis for provisional listing for such uses. Accordingly, the 
Commissioner of Food and Drugs hereby terminates the provisional 
listings of D&C Red No. 8 and D&C Red No. 9 for use in mouthwash,

[[Page 501]]

dentifrices, and ingested drugs, except ingested drug lip products, 
effective January 6, 1987.
    (u) FD&C Red No. 3. Having concluded that FD&C Red No. 3 causes 
cancer in rats, the agency hereby terminates the provisional listing of 
FD&C Red No. 3 for use in cosmetics and externally applied drugs and the 
provisional listing of the lakes of FD&C Red No. 3 for use in food, 
drug, and cosmetic products, effective January 29, 1990.

                Subpart B_Information To Be Disseminated



Sec.  99.101  Information that may be disseminated.

    (a) A manufacturer may disseminate written information concerning 
the safety, effectiveness, or benefit of a use not described in the 
approved labeling for an approved drug or device or in the statement of 
intended use for a cleared device, provided that the manufacturer 
complies with all other relevant requirements under this part. Such 
information shall:
    (1) Be about a drug or device that has been approved, licensed, or 
cleared for marketing by FDA;
    (2) Be in the form of:
    (i) An unabridged reprint or copy of an article, peer-reviewed by 
experts qualified by scientific training or experience to evaluate the 
safety or effectiveness of the drug or device involved, which was 
published in a scientific or medical journal. In addition, the article 
must be about a clinical investigation with respect to the drug or 
device and must be considered to be scientifically sound by the experts 
described in this paragraph; or
    (ii) An unabridged reference publication that includes information 
about a clinical investigation with respect to the drug or device, which 
experts qualified by scientific training or experience to evaluate the 
safety or effectiveness of the drug or device that is the subject of the 
clinical investigation would consider to be scientifically sound;
    (3) Not pose a significant risk to the public health;
    (4) Not be false or misleading. FDA may consider information 
disseminated under this part to be false or misleading if, among other 
things, the information includes only favorable publications when 
unfavorable publications exist or excludes articles, reference 
publications, or other information required under Sec.  99.103(a)(4) or 
the information presents conclusions that clearly cannot be supported by 
the results of the study; and
    (5) Not be derived from clinical research conducted by another 
manufacturer unless the manufacturer disseminating the information has 
the permission of such other manufacturer to make the dissemination.
    (b) For purposes of this part:
    (1) FDA will find that all journal articles and reference 
publications (as those terms are defined in Sec.  99.3) are 
scientifically sound except:
    (i) Letters to the editor;
    (ii) Abstracts of a publication;
    (iii) Those regarding Phase 1 trials in healthy people;
    (iv) Flagged reference publications that contain little or no 
substantive discussion of the relevant clinical investigation; and
    (v) Those regarding observations in four or fewer people that do not 
reflect any systematic attempt to collect data, unless the manufacturer 
demonstrates to FDA that such reports could help guide a physician in 
his/her medical practice.
    (2) A reprint or copy of an article or reference publication is 
``unabridged'' only if it retains the same appearance, form, format, 
content, or configuration as the original article or publication. Such 
reprint, copy of an article, or reference publication shall not be 
disseminated with any information that is promotional in nature. A 
manufacturer may cite a particular discussion about a new use in a 
reference publication in the explanatory or other information attached 
to or otherwise accompanying the reference publication under Sec.  
99.103.



Sec.  99.103  Mandatory statements and information.

article/reference publication was written and published;
    (iv) If applicable, a statement that there are products or 
treatments that have been approved or cleared for the use that is the 
subject of the information being disseminated; and
    (v) The identification of any person that has provided funding for 
the conduct of a study relating to the new use of a drug or device for 
which such information is being disseminated; and
    (2) The official labeling for the drug or device;
    (3) A bibliography of other articles (that concern reports of 
clinical investigations both supporting and not supporting the new use) 
from a scientific reference publication or scientific or medical journal 
that have been previously published about the new use of the drug or 
device covered by the information that is being disseminated, unless the 
disseminated information already includes such a bibliography; and
    (4) Any additional information required by FDA under Sec.  
99.301(a)(2). Such information shall be attached to the front of the

information, its presence shall be made known to the reader by a sticker 
or notation on the front of the disseminated information and may consist 
of:
    (i) Objective and scientifically sound information pertaining to the 
safety or effectiveness of the new use of the drug or device and which 
FDA determines is necessary to provide objectivity and balance. This may 
include information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, where 
appropriate, a summary of such information and any other information 
that can be made publicly available; and
    (ii) An objective statement prepared by FDA, based on data or other 
scientifically sound information, bearing on the safety or effectiveness 
of the new use of the drug or device.
    (b) Except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) and (a)(4) of this 
section, the statements, bibliography, and other information required by 
this section shall be attached to such disseminated information.
    (c) For purposes of this section, factors to be considered in 
determining whether a statement is ``prominently displayed'' may 
include, but are not limited to, type size, font, layout, contrast, 
graphic design, headlines, spacing, and any other technique to achieve 
emphasis or notice. The required statements shall be outlined, boxed, 
highlighted, or otherwise graphically designed and presented in a manner 
that achieves emphasis or notice and is distinct from the other 
information being disseminated.



Sec.  99.105  Recipients of information.

    A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use under this 
part may only disseminate that information to a health care 
practitioner, a pharmacy benefit manager, a health insurance issuer, a 
group health plan, or a Federal or State Government agency.

Dissemination of Information on an Unapproved Use.''



Sec.  99.205  Application for exemption from the requirement to 
file a supplemental application.

    (a) In certain circumstances, described in paragraph (b) of this 
section, a manufacturer may submit an application for an exemption from 
the requirement to submit a supplemental application for a new use for 
purposes of disseminating information on that use.
    (b) The manufacturer's application for an exemption shall identify 
the basis for the proposed exemption and shall include materials 
demonstrating that it would be economically prohibitive or that it would 
be unethical to conduct the studies necessary to submit a supplemental 
application for the new use.
    (1) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is 
that it would be economically prohibitive to incur the costs necessary 
to submit a supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer 
shall, at a minimum, provide:
    (i) Evidence explaining why existing data characterizing the safety 
and effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study 
described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to 
support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. 
Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the 
safety and effectiveness of the use, a summary of those data, and any 
documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency 
concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
    (ii) Evidence demonstrating that the cost of the study or studies 
for the new use reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use 
minus the costs of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses 
attributable to the new use of the product. Such evidence shall include:
    (A) A description of the additional studies that the manufacturer 
believes are necessary to support the submission of a supplemental 
application for the new use, including documentation from prior 
discussions, if any, with the agency concerning the studies that would 
be needed, and an estimate of the projected costs for such studies;
    (B) The expected patient population for the new use;
    (C) The expected revenue for the new use, including an explanation 
of the price at which the drug or device will be sold;
    (D) Any exclusivity for the drug or device for the new use; and
    (E) Any other information that the manufacturer has showing that 
conducting the studies on the new use would be economically prohibitive; 
and
    (iii) An attestation by a responsible individual of the manufacturer 
or an individual acting on the manufacturer's behalf verifying that the 
estimates included with the submission are accurate and were prepared in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures. The data 
underlying and supporting the estimates shall be made available to FDA 
upon request. Alternatively, a manufacturer may submit a report of an 
independent certified public accountant in accordance with the Statement 
of Standards for Attestation established by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants and agreed upon procedures performed with 
respect to the estimates submitted under this section.
    (2) If the basis for the manufacturer's application for exemption is 
that it would be unethical to conduct the studies necessary for the 
supplemental application for a new use, the manufacturer shall provide 
evidence:
    (i) Explaining why existing data characterizing the safety and 
effectiveness of the drug or device, including data from the study 
described in the information to be disseminated, are not adequate to 
support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use. 
Such evidence shall include an analysis of all data relevant to the 
safety and effectiveness of the new use, a summary of those data, and 
any documentation resulting from prior discussions with the agency 
concerning the adequacy of the existing data; and
    (ii) Explaining why it would be unethical to conduct the further 
studies that would be necessary for the approval of the new use. Such 
evidence shall establish that, notwithstanding

[[Page 517]]

the insufficiency of available data to support the submission of a 
supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to the 
extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study (e.g., 
by providing no therapy, a placebo, an alternative therapy, or an 
alternative dose) would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human 
subjects. In assessing the appropriateness of conducting studies to 
support the new use, the manufacturer may provide evidence showing that 
the new use is broadly accepted as current standard medical treatment or 
therapy. The manufacturer shall also address the possibility of 
conducting studies in different populations or of modified design (e.g., 
adding the new therapy to existing treatments or using an alternative 
dose if monotherapy studies could not be conducted).



     Subpart D_FDA Action on Submissions, Requests, and Applications



Sec.  99.301  Agency action on a submission.

    (a) Submissions. Within 60 days after receiving a submission under 
this part, FDA may:
    (1) Determine that the manufacturer does not comply with the 
requirements under this part and that, as a result, the manufacturer 
shall not disseminate any information under this part;
    (2) After providing the manufacturer notice and an opportunity for a 
meeting, determine that the information submitted regarding a new use 
fails to provide data, analyses, or other written matter that is 
objective and balanced and:
    (i) Require the manufacturer to disseminate additional information, 
including information that the manufacturer has submitted to FDA or, 
where appropriate, a summary of such information or any other 
information that can be made publicly available, which, in the agency's 
opinion:
    (A) Is objective and scientifically sound;
    (B) Pertains to the safety or effectiveness of the new use; and
    (C) Is necessary to provide objectivity and balance; and
    (ii) Require the manufacturer to disseminate an objective statement 
prepared by FDA that is based on data or other scientifically sound 
information available to the agency and bears on the safety or 
effectiveness of the drug or device for the new use; and
    (3) Require the manufacturer to maintain records that will identify 
individual recipients of the information that is to be disseminated when 
such individual records are warranted due to special safety 
considerations associated with the new use.
    (b) Protocols/Studies. Within 60 days after receiving a submission 
under this part, FDA shall:
    (1) If the manufacturer has planned studies that will be needed for 
the submission of a supplemental application for the new use, review the 
manufacturer's proposed protocols and schedule for completing such 
studies and determine whether the proposed protocols are adequate and 
whether the proposed schedule for completing the studies is reasonable. 
FDA shall notify the manufacturer of its determination; or
    (2) If the manufacturer has completed studies that the manufacturer 
believes would be an adequate basis for the submission of a supplemental 
application for the new use, conduct a review of the protocols submitted 
for such studies to determine whether they are adequate. FDA shall 
notify the manufacturer of its determination.



Sec.  99.303  Extension of time for completing planned studies.

    (a) Upon review of a drug or device manufacturer's proposed 
protocols and schedules for conducting studies needed for the submission 
of a supplemental application for a new use, FDA may, with or without a 
request for an extension from the manufacturer, determine that such 
studies cannot be completed and submitted within 36 months. The agency 
may exercise its discretion in extending the time period for completing 
the studies and submitting a supplemental application. Extensions under 
this paragraph are not subject to any time limit, but shall be made 
before the manufacturer begins the studies needed for the submission of 
a supplemental application for the new use.

[[Page 518]]

    (b) The manufacturer may, after beginning the studies needed for the 
submission of a supplemental application for a new use, request in 
writing that FDA extend the time period for conducting studies needed 
for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and 
submitting a supplemental application to FDA. FDA may grant or deny the 
request or, after consulting the manufacturer, grant an extension 
different from that requested by the manufacturer. FDA may grant a 
manufacturer's request for an extension if FDA determines that the 
manufacturer has acted with due diligence to conduct the studies needed 
for the submission of a supplemental application for a new use and to 
submit such a supplemental application to FDA in a timely manner and 
that, despite such actions, the manufacturer needs additional time to 
complete the studies and submit the supplemental application. Extensions 
under this paragraph shall not exceed 24 months.
    (c) If FDA extends the time period for completing the studies and 
submitting a supplemental application under paragraph (a) of this 
section after the manufacturer has submitted a certification under Sec.  
99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B), or if FDA grants a manufacturer's request for an 
extension under paragraph (b) of this section, the manufacturer shall 
submit a new certification under Sec.  99.201(a)(4)(ii)(B) that sets 
forth the timeframe within which clinical studies will be completed and 
a supplemental application will be submitted to FDA.



Sec.  99.305  Exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental
application.

    (a) Within 60 days after receipt of an application for an exemption 
from the requirement of a supplemental application, FDA shall approve or 
deny the application.
    (1) If FDA does not act on the application for an exemption within 
the 60-day period, the application for an exemption shall be deemed to 
be approved.
    (2) If an application for an exemption is deemed to be approved, FDA 
may, at any time, terminate such approval if it determines that the 
requirements for granting an exemption have not been met. FDA shall 
notify the manufacturer if the approval is terminated.
    (b) In reviewing an application for an exemption, FDA shall consider 
the materials submitted by the manufacturer and may consider any other 
appropriate information, including, but not limited to, any pending or 
previously approved applications for exemption submitted by the 
manufacturer.
    (c) FDA may grant an application for an exemption if FDA determines 
that:
    (1) It would be economically prohibitive for the manufacturer to 
incur the costs necessary to submit a supplemental application for a new 
use, which at a minimum requires:
    (i) That existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness 
of the drug or device, including data from the study described in the 
information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the 
submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
    (ii) That the cost of the study or studies for the new use 
reasonably exceeds the expected revenue from the new use minus the cost 
of goods sold and marketing and administrative expenses attributable to 
the new use of the product, and there are not less expensive ways to 
obtain the needed information; or
    (2) It would be unethical to conduct clinical studies needed to 
support the submission of a supplemental application for the new use 
because:
    (i) Existing data characterizing the safety and effectiveness of the 
drug or device, including data from the study described in the 
information to be disseminated are not adequate to support the 
submission of a supplemental application for the new use; and
    (ii) Although available evidence would not support the submission of 
a supplemental application for the new use, the data are persuasive to 
the extent that withholding the drug or device in a controlled study 
would pose an unreasonable risk of harm to human subjects and no studies 
in different populations or of modified design can be utilized. In 
determining whether it would be unethical to conduct clinical studies, 
the agency shall consider, in addition to the persuasiveness of 
available evidence of effectiveness, whether

[[Page 519]]

the new use of the drug or device is broadly accepted as current 
standard medical treatment or therapy.



       Subpart E_Corrective Actions and Cessation of Dissemination



Sec.  99.401  Corrective actions and cessation of dissemination of 
information.

    (a) FDA actions based on post dissemination data. If FDA receives 
data after a manufacturer has begun disseminating information on a new 
use and, based on that data, determines that the new use that is the 
subject of information disseminated under this part may not be effective 
or may present a significant risk to public health, FDA shall consult 
the manufacturer and, after such consultation, take appropriate action 
to protect the public health. Such action may include ordering the 
manufacturer to cease disseminating information on the new use and to 
take appropriate corrective action.
    (b) FDA actions based on information disseminated by a manufacturer. 
If FDA determines that a manufacturer is disseminating information that 
does not comply with the requirements under this part, FDA may:
    (1) Provide to the manufacturer an opportunity to bring itself into 
compliance with the requirements under this part if the manufacturer's 
noncompliance constitutes a minor violation of these requirements; or
    (2) Order the manufacturer to cease dissemination of information and 
to take corrective action. FDA shall issue such an order only after it 
has:
    (i) Provided notice to the manufacturer regarding FDA's intent to 
issue an order to cease dissemination; and
    (ii) Provided to the manufacturer an opportunity for a meeting. FDA 
need not provide an opportunity for a meeting if the manufacturer 
certified that it will submit a supplemental application for the new use 
within 6 months of the date that dissemination can begin and the 
noncompliance involves a failure to submit such supplemental 
application.
    (c) FDA actions based on a manufacturer's supplemental application. 
FDA may order a manufacturer to cease disseminating information under 
this part and to take corrective action if:
    (1) In the case of a manufacturer that has submitted a supplemental 
application for the new use, FDA determines that the supplemental 
application does not contain adequate information for approval of the 
new use;
    (2) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will 
submit a supplemental application for the new use within 6 months, the 
manufacturer has not, within the 6-month period, submitted a 
supplemental application for the new use;
    (3) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will 
submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or 
within such time as FDA has determined to be appropriate under Sec.  
99.303(a) or (b), such manufacturer has not submitted the supplemental 
application within the certified time, or FDA, after an informal 
hearing, has determined that the manufacturer is not acting with due 
diligence to initiate or complete the studies necessary to support a 
supplemental application for the new use; or
    (4) In the case of a manufacturer that has certified that it will 
submit a supplemental application for the new use within 36 months or 
within such time as FDA has determined to be appropriate under Sec.  
99.303(a) or (b), the manufacturer has discontinued or terminated the 
clinical studies that would be necessary to support a supplemental 
application for a new use.
    (d) Effective date of orders to cease dissemination. An order to 
cease dissemination of information shall be effective upon date of 
receipt by the manufacturer, unless otherwise stated in such order.
    (e) Cessation of dissemination by a noncomplying manufacturer. A 
manufacturer that begins to disseminate information in compliance with 
this part, but subsequently fails to comply with this part, shall 
immediately cease disseminating information under this part. A 
manufacturer that discontinues, terminates, or fails to conduct with due 
diligence clinical studies that it certified it would complete under 
Sec.  99.201(a)(4)(ii) shall be deemed not in compliance with this part. 
A manufacturer shall notify FDA immediately if

[[Page 520]]

it ceases dissemination under this paragraph.



Sec.  99.403  Termination of approvals of applications for exemption.

    (a) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application 
for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application 
if:
    (1) The application for an exemption had been deemed to be approved 
because the agency had not acted on the application within 60 days after 
its receipt by FDA;
    (2) The manufacturer is disseminating written information on the new 
use; and
    (3) FDA determines that it would be economically and ethically 
possible for the manufacturer to conduct the clinical studies needed to 
submit a supplemental application for the new use.
    (b) If FDA terminates a deemed approval of an application for an 
exemption under paragraph (a) of this section, FDA also may:
    (1) Order the manufacturer to cease disseminating information; and
    (2) Order the manufacturer to take action to correct the information 
that has been disseminated if FDA determines that the new use described 
in the disseminated information would pose a significant risk to public 
health.
    (c) FDA shall notify the manufacturer if it terminates the deemed 
approval of an application for an exemption under paragraph (a) of this 
section. If FDA also issues an order to cease dissemination of 
information, the manufacturer shall comply with the order no later than 
60 days after its receipt.
    (d) FDA may, at any time, terminate the approval of an application 
for an exemption from the requirement to file a supplemental application 
for a new use if, after consulting with the manufacturer that was 
granted such exemption, FDA determines that the manufacturer no longer 
meets the requirements for an exemption on the basis that it is 
economically prohibitive or unethical to conduct the studies needed to 
submit a supplemental application for the new use.
    (e) If FDA terminates an approval of an application for an exemption 
under paragraph (d) of this section, the manufacturer must, within 60 
days of being notified by FDA that its exemption approval has been 
terminated, file a supplemental application for the new use that is the 
subject of the information being disseminated under the exemption, 
certify, under Sec.  99.201(a)(4)(i) or (a)(4)(ii) that it will file a 
supplemental application for the new use, or cease disseminating the 
information on the new use. FDA may require a manufacturer that ceases 
dissemination of information on the new use to undertake corrective 
action.



Sec.  99.405  Applicability of labeling, adulteration, and misbranding
authority.

    The dissemination of information relating to a new use for a drug or 
device may constitute labeling, evidence of a new intended use, 
adulteration, or misbranding of the drug or device if such dissemination 
fails to comply with section 551 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 360aaa) and the requirements of this part. A 
manufacturer's failure to exercise due diligence in submitting the 
clinical studies that are necessary for the approval of a new use that 
is the subject of information disseminated under this part or in 
beginning or completing such clinical studies shall be deemed a failure 
to comply with section 551 of the act and the requirements of this part.



                   Subpart F_Recordkeeping and Reports



Sec.  99.501  Recordkeeping and reports.

    (a) A manufacturer disseminating information under this part shall:
    (1) Maintain records sufficient to allow the manufacturer to take 
corrective action as required by FDA. The manufacturer shall make such 
records available to FDA, upon request, for inspection and copying. Such 
records shall either:
    (i) Identify, by name, those persons receiving the disseminated 
information; or
    (ii) Identify, by category, the recipients of the disseminated 
information, unless FDA requires the manufacturer to retain records 
identifying individual

[[Page 521]]

recipients of the disseminated information. Manufacturers whose records 
identify recipients by category only shall:
    (A) Identify subcategories of recipients where appropriate (e.g., 
oncologists, pediatricians, obstetricians, etc.); and
    (B) Ensure that any corrective action to be taken will be 
sufficiently conspicuous to individuals within that category of 
recipients;
    (2) Maintain an identical copy of the information disseminated under 
this part; and
    (3) Upon the submission of a supplemental application to FDA, notify 
the appropriate office identified in Sec.  99.201(c) of this part.
    (b) A manufacturer disseminating information on a new use for a drug 
or device shall, on a semiannual basis, submit to the FDA office 
identified in Sec.  99.201(c) of this part:
    (1) A list containing the titles of articles and reference 
publications relating to the new use of drugs or devices that the 
manufacturer disseminated to a health care practitioner, pharmacy 
benefit manager, health insurance issuer, group health plan, or Federal 
or State Government agency. The list shall cover articles and reference 
publications disseminated in the 6-month period preceding the date on 
which the manufacturer provides the list to FDA;
    (2) A list identifying the categories of health care practitioners, 
pharmacy benefit managers, health insurance issuers, group health plans, 
or Federal or State Government agencies that received the articles and 
reference publications in the 6-month period described in paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section. The list shall also identify which category of 
recipients received a particular article or reference publication;
    (3) A notice and summary of any additional clinical research or 
other data relating to the safety or effectiveness of the new use, and, 
if the manufacturer possesses such clinical research or other data, a 
copy of the research or data. Such other data may include, but is not 
limited to, new articles published in scientific or medical journals, 
reference publications, and summaries of adverse effects that are or may 
be associated with the new use;
    (4) If the manufacturer is conducting studies necessary for the 
submission of a supplemental application, the manufacturer shall submit 
periodic progress reports on these studies to FDA. Such reports shall 
describe the studies' current status (i.e., progress on patient 
enrollment, any significant problems that could affect the 
manufacturer's ability to complete the studies, and expected completion 
dates). If the manufacturer discontinues or terminates a study before 
completing it, the manufacturer shall, as part of the next periodic 
progress report, state the reasons for such discontinuation or 
termination; and
    (5) If the manufacturer was granted an exemption from the 
requirements to submit a supplemental application for the new use, any 
new or additional information that relates to whether the manufacturer 
continues to meet the requirements for such exemption. This information 
may include, but is not limited to, new or additional information 
regarding revenues from the product that is the subject of the 
dissemination and new or additional information regarding the 
persuasiveness of the data on the new use, including information 
regarding whether the new use is broadly accepted as current standard 
medical treatment or therapy.
    (c) A manufacturer shall maintain a copy of all information, lists, 
records, and reports required or disseminated under this part for 3 
years after it has ceased dissemination of such information and make 
such documents available to FDA for inspection and copying.
